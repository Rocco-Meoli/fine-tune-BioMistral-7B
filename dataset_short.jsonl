The biological importance and activities of these compounds have been reviewed (Beier and Nigg, 1992). Briefly, LFCs are known to intercalate into DNA and form covalent bonds in the presence of UVA light (320–400 nm). Psoralens have been used to determine the structure and function of DNAs and RNAs because of their reactivity with these compounds (Cimino et al., 1985). LFCs have been used clinically to treat skin disorders such as vitiligo and prurigo nodularis and have been proposed as a treatment for jet lag. About 40 mg of psoralen administered orally, combined with UVA light, is referred to as PUVA therapy.

After 8 weeks at 6 °C, total anthocyanin content was between 73 and 84% of the content in the purees at production. After 16 weeks, the content had decreased to 56-64% of the initial values. After storage at room temperature for 8 and 16 weeks, total anthocyanin contents in the purees were 13-24 and 5-11% of the initial values, respectively. A higher retention of total anthocyanins was observed in strawberry jam stored at 20 °C for 9. weeks (33-47%), whereas retention (6-9%) similar to that in the purees in the present study was observed after about 17 weeks of storage (37). The decay of pelargonidin-3-glucoside, the main anthocyanin in strawberry purees (initially 78%), was similar to that of total anthocyanins. Pelargonidin-3-malonylglucoside was the least stable among the anthocyanins in the strawberry purees. Under storage at 22 °C, only 9-16 and 3-5% of the pelargonidin-3-malonylglucoside were left after 8 and 16 weeks, respectively. Significant demalonation has also previously been observed for malonyl esters of flavonoid glycosides (38). It is worth noting that the amount of 5-carboxypyranopelargonidin-3-glucoside, present in minor amounts in strawberry puree at production (averaging 0.6% of total anthocyanins), increased in purees made from berry homogenate and achene-enriched fraction during storage and contributed 3-4 and 7-10% of total anthocyanins in strawberry purees stored at 22 °C in 8 and 16 weeks, respectively. The higher stability of the pyrano form may be explained by the restricted formation of the unstable, colorless equilibrium forms reported for ordinary anthocyanins (31). The degradation of anthocyanins was lower in purees with higher achene levels. When initially more anthocyanins were present in purees made from flesh, this relationship changed during storage. The increased stability observed when the purees contained more achenes could be caused by stabilization of compounds originating from the achenes, probably ellagic acid-containing compounds, or could be due to the lower content of ascorbic acid, known to accelerate anthocyanin decay (39, 40)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "strawberry puree (6 °C, 8 weeks) | anthocyanins (total) | 73-84 | % of initial\nstrawberry puree (6 °C, 16 weeks) | anthocyanins (total) | 56-64 | % of initial\nstrawberry puree (22 °C, 8 weeks) | anthocyanins (total) | 13-24 | % of initial\nstrawberry puree (22 °C, 16 weeks) | anthocyanins (total) | 5-11 | % of initial\nstrawberry puree (22 °C, 8 weeks) | pelargonidin-3-malonylglucoside | 9-16 | % of initial\nstrawberry puree (22 °C, 16 weeks) | pelargonidin-3-malonylglucoside | 3-5 | % of initial\nstrawberry puree (22 °C, 8 weeks) | 5-carboxypyranopelargonidin-3-glucoside | 3-4 | % of total anthocyanins\nstrawberry puree (22 °C, 16 weeks) | 5-carboxypyranopelargonidin-3-glucoside | 7-10 | % of total anthocyanins"}], "meta": {"split": "train", "paper_id": "polyphenol-composition-and-antioxidant-activity-in-strawberry-purees-impact-of-achene-level-and-storage", "chunk_id": "p45", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

It is interesting that the spectra of raw garlic and red onion have specific bands in the range of molecular masses from 50 to 112 kDa that disappeared after heat treatment . The boiling procedure for more than 20 min caused degradation of the proteins in studied vegetables. The 14 kDa bands in raw garlic and onions during electrophoretic separation without reduction had more proteins than the treated samples. The 50, 70, 77, 100, 102, and 112 kDa bands disappeared after treatment, probably as less stable proteins in these vegetables.

A decrease in the amount of total AX and a redistribution from WUE AX to WE AX was also reported during wheat bread baking . The relative increase in the water-extractability of DF during dough mixing was probably caused by the solubilisation of WUE DF components. The decrease in the total DF content can be explained by breakdown of WE DF components to smaller molecules which were no longer precipitated by 80% ethanol and thus not counted as DF by the method used. No changes in water extractability were measured during dough proofing. However, this does not exclude the possibility that some breakdown of AX to lower molecular weight polymers could have occurred during this processing step. In wheat bread baking a decrease in molecular weight of water-extractable AX was observed after mixing and in the first 30 min of fermentation .

The extraction procedure for soluble and insoluble phenolic compounds presented in our previous study (28) was modified for the analysis of flavan-3-ols and low molecular weight proanthocyanidins. The scheme of the two-phase solvent extraction method is shown in Figure 2. Samples of the edible part of the berry (5 g) were weighed in centrifuge tubes, and 0. mL of morin (concentrated 1 mg/mL in methanol) was added as an internal standard for the quantification of flavan-3-ols and proanthocyanidins. Morin was a suitable standard to compensate for the losses of flavan-3-ols in the purification step, since it showed a similar solubility in the extraction solvents. The extractions were performed by repeated vigorous vortexing of samples with ethyl acetate (4 × 10 mL) and intermittent centrifugation. The combined ethyl acetate extracts were divided into two portions (20 mL each) containing soluble free and conjugated forms of hydroxycinnamic acids, gallic acid, ellagic acid, and flavonols as well as flavan-3-ols, low molecular weight proanthocyanidins, and some ellagitannins. One 20 mL portion was evaporated to dryness with a rotary evaporator, dissolved in 1 mL of methanol, and analyzed with LC-DAD (high-performance liquid chromatography combined with diode array detection) and LC-MS (high-performance liquid chromatography combined with electrospray ionization mass spectrometric detection). Another 20 mL portion was extracted with 2 × 10 mL of sodium acetate buffer (0. M, adjusted to pH 7.0) and then with 10 mL of water to remove ionizable phenolic acids into the water phase. After this purification step, the extract was evaporated to dryness with a rotary evaporator and dissolved in 1 mL of methanol for analysis of flavan-3-ols and dimeric proanthocyanidin with LC-DAD. After the ethyl acetate extraction, the berry residue was acidified with HCl (2 M, 2 mL), and anthocyanins were extracted as flavylium cations with methanol four times to a total extraction volume of $\\sim 50$ mL.

All thermalprocessing treatments significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the contents of each individual anthocyanin in black beans. In comparison to the other thermal processing methods, regular steaming retained a higher content of delphinidin-3-glucoside, malvidin-3,5-diglucoside, and petunidin-3-glucoside, while pressure steaming eliminated all malvidin-3-glucoside and malvidin-3-galactoside. Only trace amounts of delphindin-3-glucoside (22. μg/g), petunidin-3-glucoside (11. μg/g), and malvidin-3-glucoside (6. μg/g) were retained in the pressure-steamed black beans. There were no significant differences in anthocyanin contents between regular and pressure boiled black beans. In comparison to the raw black beans, thermal processing lost 93.3-99% of delphinidin-3 glucoside, 58.8-100% malvidin-3,5-diglucoside, 91.5-98.7% petunidin-3-glucoside, 100% malvidin-3-galactoside, and 88.2- 98.5% malvidin-3-glucoside.

In a first approach, an analysis of variance was performed on each apple material (pulp, peel, juice) data matrix, made up of individual polyphenol concentrations, total procyanidin contents, and DPn (seasons 2000 and 2001). Most variables were not significantly different except for some features that were present in very low concentrations (<2% of total polyphenol content). Moreover, box and whisker plots of these features confirmed that they were not totally discriminant between the two seasons. These differences observed in some features are likely due to the influence on fruit composition of certain factors such as the weather, the nutrient status of the soil, and other environmental factors (6). Therefore, they were considered as part of the possible variability that apple compositions could present among seasons. CA and PCA were carried out on the data of each apple material, but no natural groupings of the samples due to the harvest season were detected in pulp and peel. However, in juice, two partially overlapped groups were observed.

Bressani and Elias (28 ) observed that about 30-40% of phenolics could be removed from common beans by cooking and discarding the cooking water. In the present study, it was found that about 63- 77% of TPC, 67-84% of TFC, 32-54% of CTC, and 0-100% of MAC were reduced in pinto beans. Both regular boiling and pressure boiling lost much more TPC (about 71-77%) than steaming treatments in pinto beans. In the case of black beans, about 61-74% of TPC, 61-79% of TFC, 68-73% CTC, and 88-100% MAC losses were found in thermal-processed black beans. In addition, boiling treatment reduced more TPC and TFC than steaming processing. Pressure steaming reduced more TPC, TFC, CTC, and MAC values than regular steaming. These results on the variations of TPC by processing are in good agreement with those reported by Ismail et al. (29 ), who found that thermal treatment decreased the TPC in all vegetables. These results also exhibited trends similar to those of our previous papers (9, 11, 24), in which we showed that thermal processing lost 50-70% of TPC in peas, 70-80% of TPC in black common beans, and 43-63% of TPC in black soybean. These significant losses might be attributed to those water-soluble phenolics that were leached into soaking and cooking water before and during thermal processing as well as the breakdown of phenolics during processing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "pinto beans (thermal processing) | total phenolics (TPC) loss | 63-77 | %\npinto beans (thermal processing) | total flavonoids (TFC) loss | 67-84 | %\npinto beans (thermal processing) | condensed tannins (CTC) loss | 32-54 | %\npinto beans (thermal processing) | monomeric anthocyanins (MAC) loss | 0-100 | %\nblack beans (thermal processing) | total phenolics (TPC) loss | 61-74 | %\nblack beans (thermal processing) | total flavonoids (TFC) loss | 61-79 | %\nblack beans (thermal processing) | condensed tannins (CTC) loss | 68-73 | %\nblack beans (thermal processing) | monomeric anthocyanins (MAC) loss | 88-100 | %"}], "meta": {"split": "train", "paper_id": "total-phenolic-phenolic-acid-anthocyanin-flavan-3-ol-and-flavonol-profiles-and-antioxidant-properties-of-pinto-and", "chunk_id": "p34", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

Analyses were done using a high-performance liquid chromatograph equipped with a diode array detector. Significant differences in the contents of identified phenolics were observed among cultivars. Phenolics were determined separately in the kernel and in the thin skin of the walnut, termed the pellicle. Not only in the kernel but also in the pellicle did syringic acid, juglone, and ellagic acid predominate (average values of 33.83, 11.75, and 5. mg/100 g of kernel; and 1003.24, 317.90, and 128. mg/100 g of pellicle, respectively), and the contents of ferulic and sinapic acid (average values of 0. and 0. mg/100 g of kernel and 2. and 2. mg/100 g of pellicle, respectively) were the lowest in all cultivars. The highest differences in the sum of all identified phenolics were observed between Rasna and Fernette fruits; in Rasna there were >2-fold higher contents of identified phenolics in both kernel and pellicle. It was found that the walnut pellicle is the most important source of walnut phenolics. The ratio between the contents in pellicle and kernel varied by at least 14.8-fold for caffeic acid (cv. Adams) and by up to 752.0-fold for p-coumaric acid (cv. Elit)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "walnut kernel | syringic acid | 33.83 | mg/100 g\nwalnut kernel | juglone | 11.75 | mg/100 g\nwalnut kernel | ellagic acid | 5. | mg/100 g\nwalnut kernel | ferulic acid | 0. | mg/100 g\nwalnut kernel | sinapic acid | 0. | mg/100 g\nwalnut pellicle | syringic acid | 1003.24 | mg/100 g\nwalnut pellicle | juglone | 317.90 | mg/100 g\nwalnut pellicle | ellagic acid | 128. | mg/100 g\nwalnut pellicle | ferulic acid | 2. | mg/100 g\nwalnut pellicle | sinapic acid | 2. | mg/100 g"}], "meta": {"split": "train", "paper_id": "phenolic-acids-syringaldehyde-and-juglone-in-fruits-of-different-cultivars-of-juglans-regia-l", "chunk_id": "p1", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

Garlic contained 639. mg/kg myricetin, 47. mg/kg quercetin, and 217. mg/kg apigenin. Cao et al.

The injection volume was 20 $\\mu$ L, and the carotenoids were eluted with a flow of 0. mL/min, following this linear gradient: starting condition, 82% A and 18% B; at 20 min, 76% A and 24% B; at 30 min, 58% A and 42% B; at 40 min, 40% A and 60% B; and at 45 min, 82% A and 18% B. Phase A was a mixture of acetonitrile, n-hexane, methanol, and dichloromethane (2:1:1:1, v/v/v/v), while phase B was acetonitrile.

A Spherisorb ODS-2 (5 µm, 25 cm × 4. mm i.d., Waters Inc.) column was used. Separation was achieved using an elution gradient with an initial composition of 90% water (pH adjusted to 3. with phosphoric acid) and 10% methanol. The concentration of the latter solvent was increased to 30% over 10 min and maintained for 20 min. Subsequently, the methanol percentage was raised to 40% over 10 min, maintained for 5 min, and then increased to 50%. Finally, the methanol percentage was increased to 60, 70, and 100% in 5 min periods. Initial conditions were reached in 15 min. A flow of 1 mL/min and a temperature of 35 °C were used in all of the experiments. A Waters 996 diode array detector and a Jasco FP-920 fluorescence detector (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) were connected in series. Compounds 5 and 6 were monitored by UV at 280 nm, compounds 11 and 12 at 340 nm, the oleosidic compounds at 240 nm, and the rest of the phenolic compounds by fluorescence with an excitation wavelength at 280 nm and an emission wavelength at 320 nm. Both detectors were operated with Millenium 2015 software (Waters Inc.). Quantification of phenolic compounds was made by using and internal standard (syringic acid). Compounds 1 and 3 were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO) and compounds 11 and 12 from Extrasynthese (Z. I. Lyon-Nord, Genay, France).

Few studies have investigated the antioxidant activity of foods exerted by intrinsic hydrophilic and lipophilic chemical components. Most antioxidant research has focused on determining the antioxidant activity of watersoluble food extracts, in spite of the role of some lipid components on the prevention of some stress-oxidative diseases (7, 33). There are limited data on processing effects; data from the USDA on 100 different sorts of foods showed that the cooking process can increase or decrease the antioxidant activity of foods depending on the nature and molecular structure of the antioxidant compound (33). The sequential heat treatments of lime-cooking, tortilla baking, and tortilla chip frying affected the antioxidant activity. Deep-fat frying had the most detrimental effect on antioxidant capacity because tortilla chips contained <50% of the antioxidant capacity of the raw grain.

The hydroxycinnamate tartaric acid esters may have been hydrolyzed in the fermentation process, giving as a result free cinnamic acids, which can be also oxidized (Cilliers and Singleton, 1989). They can be transformed into volatile phenols by decarboxylase activity provided by yeast (Chatonnet et al., 1993; Dugelay et al., 1993) or presumably adsorbed by interaction with yeasts (Somers et al., 1987).

The bilberry extract was orally or intravenously administered to rats, and the plasma levels of each anthocyanin were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. As the result, all anthocyanins except peonidin 3-O-α-L-arabinoside were detectable in the blood plasma. The plasma concentration of anthocyanins as a whole reached the maximum level of 1. $\\mu$ M at 15 min after oral administration of 400 mg/kg bilberry extract (153. mg/kg as anthocyanins) and then decreased with time. Uptake and decay profiles of each anthocyanin in the plasma were almost the same for all anthocyanins except a few with their maximum after 30 min. Among the anthocyanins carrying the same aglycone, the plasma level after 15 min of oral administration was as follows: galactoside > glucoside > arabinoside. Plasma clearance of anthocyanins after intravenous administration clearly showed that arabinoside disappeared more rapidly than glucoside and galactoside. On the other hand, when anthocyanins carrying the same sugar moiety were compared, the half disappearance time of plasma anthocyanins was in the following order: delphinidin > cyanidin > petunidin = peonidin > malvidin. The bioavailability of anthocyanins was in the range of 0.61-1.82% and was 0.93% as the anthocyanin mixture. The bioavailability of anthocyanins carrying the same aglycone was in the following order: Galactoside showed the highest followed by glucoside and arabinoside for cyanidin and delphinidin, but arabinoside and galactoside showed a higher bioavailability than glucoside for petunidin and malvidin. Anthocyanins recovered in urine and bile during the first 4 h after intravenous administration were only 30. and 13.4%, respectively. Anthocyanin profiles in tissues were quite different from those in blood plasma. The major anthocyanins distributed in liver and kidney were the O-methyl anthocyanins such as peonidin, malvidin, and other O-methyl anthocyanins derived from delphinidin, cyanidin, and petunidin-glycosides."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "NONE"}], "meta": {"split": "train", "paper_id": "bioavailability-and-tissue-distribution-of-anthocyanins-in-bilberry-(vaccinium-myrtillus-l-)-extract-in-rats", "chunk_id": "p2", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

The anthocyanin bioavailability of red cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var. capitata) was evaluated as reflected by urinary excretion of anthocyanins and anthocyanin metabolites. Twelve volunteers consumed 100, 200, and 300 g of steamed red cabbage (containing 1. $\\mu$ mol of anthocyanins/g of cabbage) in a crossover design. Anthocyanin concentration in cabbage extract and urine was measured by HPLC-MS/MS. Six nonacylated and 30 acylated anthocyanins were detected in red cabbage, and 3 nonacylated anthocyanins, 8 acylated anthocyanins, and 4 metabolites were present in urine. Mean 24 h excretion of intact anthocyanins increased linearly from 45 (100 g dose) to 65 nmol (300 g dose) for acylated anthocyanins and from 52 (100 g dose) to 79 nmol (300 g dose) for nonacylated anthocyanins. Urinary recovery of intact anthocyanins (percent of anthocyanin intake) decreased linearly from 0.041% (100 g dose) to 0.020% (300 g dose) for acylated anthocyanins and from 0.18% (100 g dose) to 0.09% (300 g dose) for nonacylated anthocyanins. Anthocyanin metabolites consisted of glucuronidated and methylated anthocyanins.

The major flavonoids in capsicums are myricetin and quercetin. Quercetin was not detected in green chili. Bird chili contained the highest level of luteolin (1035. mg/kg) among all the samples tested. Therefore, consumption of bird chili may reduce risk of tumorigenesis because luteolin was shown to be a potent inhibitor to enzyme lipoxygenase and prostaglandin synthetase (12). Contents of flavonoids and other phenolics, including capsaicinoid, in bird chili vary with fruit maturation (26). Bell pepper contained 171. mg/kg myricetin, 448. mg/kg quercetin, and 272. mg/kg apigenin. Lee et al.

The low antioxidant activity of cereal extracts even at a 5000 ppm level against oxidation of methyl linoleate was also reported by Kahkonen et al. (41). The low TPC in the above study may possibly be due to the inclusion of only free phenolics in the analysis. However, in cereals, phenolic compounds exist primarily in the bound form in association with cell wall materials (10-13, 42-44). The present study also demonstrated the significant contribution of bound phenolic compounds to the TPCs of whole grains, flours, and brans of soft and hard wheats. Thus, it is apparent why cereals could exhibit low TPCs when tested only for their free phenolic acids. A similar conclusion was reached by Dewanto et al. (45) for corn phenolics and dominance of bound phenolics. Sosulski et al. (10) reported that 69.2% of TPCs in wheat was due to insoluble-bound phenolics.

The method is a modified version of the method described by Sancho et al. . Crude extract (3 ml) was mixed with the methyl esterified substrates (MFA, MSA or MpCA; final concentration 1 mM, final volume 6 ml) and incubated for 30 min in phosphate buffer (0. M; pH 7.0) at 30 °C. An amount of crude extract was used that resulted in less than 5% conversion of substrate to product and a linear reaction curve with time. Blanks containing either crude extract (3 ml) or phosphate buffer (3 ml, 0. M; pH 7.0) were incubated as controls. A third blank containing substrate and buffer was also incubated to check the stability of the substrate during the incubation. Reactions were stopped by addition of HCl (0. ml, 1. M; final pH<2.5). An internal standard solution [0. µmol anisic acid (Sigma)] was added and the sample was extracted with EtOAc (1×5 ml). The organic phase was separated from the aqueous phase by centrifugation (10.000×g, 10 min), dried with anhydrous Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and evaporated to dryness in a rotary evaporator (30 °C). The residue was then dissolved in 0. ml MeOH, diluted with 0. ml of 0.5% TFA in water (pH~2.2), and filtered (0. µm, nylon, polypropylene, Lida) prior to HPLC/DAD analysis of the released hydroxycinnamic acids and anisic acid as described by Andreasen et al. . Analytical HPLC was performed with a Merck Hitachi HPLC equipped with a diode array detector (L-7450). The diode array detector was employed at 280 and 320 nm and the UV spectra were recorded between 220 and 360 nm. Separations were performed on a RP-18 column (LiCroCART 100, Merck) at 35 °C, by isocratic elution for 12 min with the following solvent: 50:50 (v/v) MeOH:0.5‰ TFA in water, pH~2.2. The flow rate was 1 ml min $^{-1}$ , the injection volume 40 $\\mu$ l and $\\it trans$ -ferulic acid, $\\it trans$ -sinapic acid and $\\it trans$ -p-coumaric acid (Sigma) were used as external standards."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "NONE"}], "meta": {"split": "val", "paper_id": "s00217-001-0417-6", "chunk_id": "p29", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

This reveals that most of the condensed tannins are located in the skins of hazelnuts. Several studies have found that phenolic compounds including condensed tannins are mainly located in the skin of the nut (22-25).

Among these, the catechins constitute the major components, with up to 26-30% of the dry matter of the fresh leaf. Catechins make an important contribution, especially to the bitter and astringent taste of green tea. Tea has been considered as a crude medicine in China for more than 4000 years. Different kinds of pharmacological effects such as protection of blood vessels, reduction of serum cholesterol levels, and prevention of arteriosclerosis were reported as integrated effects (Cheng et al., 1988). The major active principles of tea have been identified as catechins. Their action mechanisms of anticarcinogenesis have been attributed to the competitive inhibition of cytochrome P450 involved in the bioactivation of various carcinogens, as well as to antioxidant properties as scavengers of reactive oxygen species (Katiyar et al., 1993)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "fresh tea leaf | catechins (total) | 26–30 | % of dry weight"}], "meta": {"split": "test", "paper_id": "survey-of-catechins-gallic-acid-and-methylxanthines-in-green-oolong-pu-erh-and-black-teas", "chunk_id": "p36", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

Most foods we investigated varied between 100 and 800 ppm of total isoflavones, with low levels observed in items processed by mixing with nonsoy components (cheeses) and with high levels observed in dry items (soy protein drink powders). A large contribution to the variability in isoflavone content was found to be due to moisture. This occurred because most foods were found to have very similar isoflavone levels after correcting for water content, which is also apparent from the difference observed for raw (dry) and cooked (wet) foods, especially, in foo jook and soybeans . Differences between raw and cooked foods that could not be explained by moisture were partly due to leaching of the polar isoflavone conjugates into the boiling water during processing. We determined isoflavone levels in the water used for boiling of some representative boiled items and found isoflavone amounts equaling almost exactly the difference between cooked and raw items after adjustment of moisture (data not shown). This was true not only for total isoflavones but, in particular, for the polar conjugates. Boiling for up to 1 h did not considerably change the conjugation or aglycon pattern. The temperature applied was probably too low and the period of boiling too short to lead to a sufficient hydrolysis and decarboxylation of the conjugates or degradation of the aglycons observed with dry heat such as roasting, toasting, or frying in oil (Coward et al., 1993; Barnes et al., 1994a; Franke et al., 1994).

All reagents including trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and methanol (MeOH) were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries Co. Ltd. (Japan) and used without further purification. Bilberon 25, a concentrated extract of wild-type blueberry (V. myrtillus L.), was generously donated by Tokiwa Phytochemical Co. Ltd. (Japan). The structures of bilberry anthocyanins are shown in Figure 1. The anthocyanin contents in the Bilberon sample were determined by HPLC using authentic anthocyanins as standards, and the results are given in Table 1. Fifteen types of authentic anthocyanins were purified from bilberry extract by the method described in our previous paper (1). Briefly, Bilberon 25 (10 g) was dissolved in 1% TFA aqueous solution (10 mL) and subjected to low-pressure liquid chromatography (Waters, United States). Anthocyanins were recovered in the fraction eluted with 30% MeOH containing 1% TFA (yield, 3. g). The anthocyanin fraction was further chromatographed over MCI-gel CHP-20 (45 cm × 4. cm) (Mitsubishi, Japan) with H<sub>2</sub>O containing increased amounts of MeOH (0:1 $\\rightarrow$ 1:0) to give 11 fractions. Anthocyanin-containing fractions were further separated by Sephadex LH-20 chromatography (26 cm × 2. cm) (Amarsham Biosciences Co., United States). Each anthocyanin was purified by HPLC (HITACHI L-7000) equipped with a Develosil ODS-HG5 column (250 mm × 20 mm, Nomura Chemical Co. Ltd., Japan), with 20% MeOH containing 0.1% TFA as the elution solvent.

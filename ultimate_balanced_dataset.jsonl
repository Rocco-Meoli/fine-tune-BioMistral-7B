The extracts were automatically diluted to four concentrations in duplicates by Biomek 2000 Workstation (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA), and 20 $\\mu$ L of samples, blanks, and Trolox were added to a black 96-well microplate (96F, Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark). The fluorescein fluorescence was recorded every 3 min after the addition of AAPH until the fluorescence was <5% of the initial reading. Final results were calculated using the differences of areas under the fluorescein decay curves between the blank and a sample and were expressed as micromoles of Trolox equivalents (TE) per gram of fresh weight (µmol of TE/g of fw)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "NONE"}], "meta": {"split": "train", "paper_id": "polyphenol-composition-and-antioxidant-activity-in-strawberry-purees-impact-of-achene-level-and-storage", "chunk_id": "p19", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

The applied heat treatments, including cooking and dehydration, likely induce degradation of highly polymerized proanthocyanidins, cleavage of glycosidic bonds in flavonoids, and decomposition of aglycones (10, 29).

A comparison in terms of antioxidant capacity was made between different salads, as well as between salads to which aromatic herbs had been added.

In the present study on wheat, bound phenolics accounted for approximately 40% of the TPC in wheat flour, 60% in wheat whole grain, and 80% in wheat bran.

Antioxidant capacities of various salads were compared, including versions to which aromatic herbs had been added. Incorporation of lemon balm or marjoram at 1. % w/w raised the antioxidant capacity of a salad portion by 150 % and 200 %, respectively.

Among the dressings evaluated, olive oils and wine or apple vinegars produced the largest enhancement of antioxidant capacity, whereas cumin and fresh ginger were the spices showing the strongest effects.

After 8 weeks at 6 °C, total anthocyanin content was between 73 and 84% of the content in the purees at production. After 16 weeks, the content had decreased to 56-64% of the initial values. After storage at room temperature for 8 and 16 weeks, total anthocyanin contents in the purees were 13-24 and 5-11% of the initial values, respectively. A higher retention of total anthocyanins was observed in strawberry jam stored at 20 °C for 9. weeks (33-47%), whereas retention (6-9%) similar to that in the purees in the present study was observed after about 17 weeks of storage (37). The decay of pelargonidin-3-glucoside, the main anthocyanin in strawberry purees (initially 78%), was similar to that of total anthocyanins. Pelargonidin-3-malonylglucoside was the least stable among the anthocyanins in the strawberry purees. Under storage at 22 °C, only 9-16 and 3-5% of the pelargonidin-3-malonylglucoside were left after 8 and 16 weeks, respectively. Significant demalonation has also previously been observed for malonyl esters of flavonoid glycosides (38). It is worth noting that the amount of 5-carboxypyranopelargonidin-3-glucoside, present in minor amounts in strawberry puree at production (averaging 0.6% of total anthocyanins), increased in purees made from berry homogenate and achene-enriched fraction during storage and contributed 3-4 and 7-10% of total anthocyanins in strawberry purees stored at 22 °C in 8 and 16 weeks, respectively. The higher stability of the pyrano form may be explained by the restricted formation of the unstable, colorless equilibrium forms reported for ordinary anthocyanins (31). The degradation of anthocyanins was lower in purees with higher achene levels. When initially more anthocyanins were present in purees made from flesh, this relationship changed during storage. The increased stability observed when the purees contained more achenes could be caused by stabilization of compounds originating from the achenes, probably ellagic acid-containing compounds, or could be due to the lower content of ascorbic acid, known to accelerate anthocyanin decay (39, 40)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "strawberry puree (6 °C, 8 weeks) | anthocyanins (total) | 73-84 | % of initial\nstrawberry puree (6 °C, 16 weeks) | anthocyanins (total) | 56-64 | % of initial\nstrawberry puree (22 °C, 8 weeks) | anthocyanins (total) | 13-24 | % of initial\nstrawberry puree (22 °C, 16 weeks) | anthocyanins (total) | 5-11 | % of initial\nstrawberry puree (22 °C, 8 weeks) | pelargonidin-3-malonylglucoside | 9-16 | % of initial\nstrawberry puree (22 °C, 16 weeks) | pelargonidin-3-malonylglucoside | 3-5 | % of initial\nstrawberry puree (production) | 5-carboxypyranopelargonidin-3-glucoside | 0.6 | % of total anthocyanins\nstrawberry puree (22 °C, 8 weeks) | 5-carboxypyranopelargonidin-3-glucoside | 3-4 | % of total anthocyanins\nstrawberry puree (22 °C, 16 weeks) | 5-carboxypyranopelargonidin-3-glucoside | 7-10 | % of total anthocyanins"}], "meta": {"split": "train", "paper_id": "polyphenol-composition-and-antioxidant-activity-in-strawberry-purees-impact-of-achene-level-and-storage", "chunk_id": "p45", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

Since local plant material (black carrot, Germany) was abundant, roots were harvested at four different sites of the experimental plots at different stages, beginning at the end of August and ending mid-October, thus allowing the evaluation of the infra-specific variability of anthocyanin accumulation as well as of the influence of harvest date on pigment concentration of the roots. The total anthocyanin contents depending on harvest time are presented in Fig. 3. Most obviously, pigment contents within the same cultivar are subject to great variation, especially for the second, third and fourth harvest date. In general, maximal total anthocyanin contents were observed between mid-September and October. The pigment pattern showed only minor differences throughout this period. The average proportion of acylated compounds ranged from 80. (end of August) to 84.8% (mid-October), without showing significant differences.

The biological importance and activities of these compounds have been reviewed (Beier and Nigg, 1992). Briefly, LFCs are known to intercalate into DNA and form covalent bonds in the presence of UVA light (320–400 nm). Psoralens have been used to determine the structure and function of DNAs and RNAs because of their reactivity with these compounds (Cimino et al., 1985). LFCs have been used clinically to treat skin disorders such as vitiligo and prurigo nodularis and have been proposed as a treatment for jet lag. About 40 mg of psoralen administered orally, combined with UVA light, is referred to as PUVA therapy.

Uptake and decay profiles of each anthocyanin in the plasma were almost the same for all anthocyanins except a few with their maximum after 30 min. Among the anthocyanins carrying the same aglycone, the plasma level after 15 min of oral administration was as follows: galactoside > glucoside > arabinoside. Plasma clearance of anthocyanins after intravenous administration clearly showed that arabinoside disappeared more rapidly than glucoside and galactoside.

Anthocyanins recovered in urine and bile during the first 4 h after intravenous administration were only 30. and 13.4%, respectively.

On the other hand, predictions made in peel for some varieties differed from the results obtained in pulp. In this sense, MX2 (2000) and PT (2000) classified as bitter in pulp were predicted as nonbitter in peel, whereas GG (2001) and MX11 (2001), nonbitter in pulp, were classified as bitter in peel. An explanation of this observation could be the fact that apple peel composition depends to a great extent on climatology (6) and sun exposure of the fruit, existing differences according to the position of the fruit in the tree and even, in the same fruit, between sun-exposed parts and shaded parts (25). Considering the peel and pulp distribution of polyphenols in the different apple cultivars studied, it was confirmed that the synthesis and accumulation of phenolic compounds are specific to each kind of apple tissue (peel, pulp), which had been previously reported (25, 26). Taking into account the objective of this study, and as a result of the observations made, pulp predictions were considered as more reliable than those in peel, because they were more homogeneous and did not depend so much on external factors. However, it is important to note that for 80% of the samples, bitterness predictions are concordant in pulp and peel, which allows the conclusion that apple tissues present characteristic compositions that permit them to be distinguished from a technological point of view."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "NONE"}], "meta": {"split": "train", "paper_id": "polyphenolic-profiles-of-basque-cider-apple-cultivars-and-their-technological-properties", "chunk_id": "p31", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

Le informazioni disponibili sull’effetto dei processi tecnologici sono limitate, ma dati USDA relativi a circa 100 alimenti indicano che la cottura può tanto aumentare quanto ridurre l’attività antiossidante, in funzione della natura e della struttura degli antiossidanti (33). Nella filiera di trasformazione del mais in masa, tortillas e tortilla chips, la serie di trattamenti termici modifica sensibilmente la capacità antiossidante. La frittura profonda utilizzata per produrre i tortilla chips è il passaggio più critico: il prodotto finale conserva meno della metà della capacità antiossidante del grano crudo. Al contrario, la semplice cottura della masa in tortillas comporta un lieve incremento dell’attività antiossidante, verosimilmente dovuto all’aumento di fenoli solubili liberati dalla matrice."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "tortilla chips | antioxidant capacity | <50 | % of raw grain"}], "meta": {"split": "train", "paper_id": "effect-of-processing-on-the-phytochemical-profiles-and-antioxidant-activity-of-corn-for-production-of-masa-tortillas", "chunk_id": "p41_d", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

Thus, the changes of ORAC values could be attributed to the leaching of phenolic compounds into the soaking and cooking water.

The anthocyanin contents of the original raw and cooked pinto and black beans are presented in Table 3. Anthocyanins were not detectable in the raw and cooked pinto beans. Five anthocyanins, namely, delphinidin-3-glucoside, malvidin-3,5-diglucoside, petunidin-3-glucoside, malvidin-3-galactoside, and malvidin-3-glucoside, were detected in the raw black beans. The dominant components were delphinidin-3-glucoside, malvidin-3,5-diglucoside, petunidin-3-glucoside, and malvidin-3-glucoside. These findings are in accordance with those of Takeoka et al. (5 ) and Wu and Prior (35 ), who found that delphinidin-3-glucoside, petunidin-3-glucoside, and malvidin-3-glucoside were the major anthocyanins in black common beans. The discrepancy was that malvidin-3,5-diglucoside as the third major component after delphinidin-3-glucoside and petunidin-3-glucoside was detected in our pinto bean sample at a higher content than malvidin-3 glucoside. However, malvidin-3,5-diglucoside was reported as the minor anthocyanin in black beans in previous studies (5, 35).

For all causes of mortality, only daily wine intake (22–32 g of alcohol) was associated with a lower risk due to lower incidence of cardiovascular diseases and cancers, and it was concluded that moderate consumption of only wine was associated with a lower all-cause mortality. Attention turned to the nonalcoholic fractions of wine, and particularly red wine, as an important source of polyphenols, which are capable of inhibiting the processes behind CAD. This hypothesis is supported by the results of recent epidemiological studies concerning foodstuff polyphenols, particularly flavonoids. A correlation was also noticed between increasing levels of flavonoid ingestion from fruit and vegetables and reduction in CAD. The studies carried out by Hertog et al. (7), Knekt et al.

Solvents that constituted the mobile phase were acetic acid/water, 10:90, v/v (A), and methanol (B). The elution conditions applied were as follows: 0–10 min, 0% B isocratic; 10–40 min, linear gradient from 0 to 15% B; 40–60 min, 15% B isocratic; and finally, washing and reconditioning of the column.

Saco mostrava il contenuto più elevato di rutin (14 mg/100 g di peso fresco), mentre le cvs. Burlat e Summit presentavano solo 3 mg/100 g di fw, valori che rappresentavano circa il 5% e il 3% del contenuto totale di fenoli, rispettivamente. Il livello di rutin tendeva ad aumentare con l’avanzare della maturazione: nel caso di Saco, nel 2002, si osservava un passaggio da 3 a 10 mg/100 g di fw, ovvero un incremento di circa tre volte, dallo stadio parzialmente maturo a quello maturo. Nel periodo di conservazione, il contenuto di flavonoli nelle ciliegie, indipendentemente dallo stadio di maturazione iniziale e dalla temperatura di stoccaggio, rimaneva sostanzialmente invariato."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cv.

After 16 weeks at 22 °C, 0. mg/100 g of fw, averaging 28% of the start levels, remained in the purees. The rapid degradation of (+)-catechin may be explained by enzymatic oxidation, as this ortho-diphenolic compound is shown to be a major substrate for oxidases (14, 41). Even if heat treatment, as in the current experiment, normally will inactivate oxidative enzymes (42), a partially thermostable peroxidase, which has been detected in strawberries (43), may have contributed to the degradation. There was a slight decline in p-coumaroyl glycosides in stored purees made from flesh; that is, the concentration after 16 weeks of storage at 22 °C was 92% of the levels in the purees at production. p-Coumaroyl glycosides in purees containing more achenes were less stable, with 86 and 72% left in purees made from berry homogenate and achene-enriched fraction, respectively.

Most variables were not significantly different except for some features that were present in very low concentrations (<2% of total polyphenol content).

Then, the cartridges were washed successively with 3 mL of 3% TFA aqueous solution, dichloromethane, and benzene (3 mL each). Anthocyanins were eluted with 50% acetonitrile containing 1% TFA aqueous solution. The recovered anthocyanins were evaporated to dryness in vacuo at a temperature below 40 °C and dissolved in 150 µL of distilled water containing 0.5% TFA, and then, an aliquot (100 µL) of the solutions was injected into an HPLC system (Hitachi 7200). In the case of intravenous administered plasma samples, further dilution was carried out depending on the color of the samples. Urine and bile samples were prepared as described above using Sep-Pak C18 cartridges Environment (Waters). All of the washing and elution procedures were carried out using 10 mL of the solvent. HPLC was carried out on a Develosil ODS HG-5 column (Nomura Chemical Co.

The recovery of anthocyanins through the above method was checked using Bilberon 25, and it was determined as 87.5%. A calibration curve for each anthocyanin was made using purified anthocyanidin-glycoside (3-O-glycopyranoside of delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, peonidin, and malvidin) as the reference.

The anthocyanin bioavailability of red cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var. capitata) was evaluated as reflected by urinary excretion of anthocyanins and anthocyanin metabolites. Twelve volunteers consumed 100, 200, and 300 g of steamed red cabbage (containing 1. $\\mu$ mol of anthocyanins/g of cabbage) in a crossover design. Anthocyanin concentration in cabbage extract and urine was measured by HPLC-MS/MS. Six nonacylated and 30 acylated anthocyanins were detected in red cabbage, and 3 nonacylated anthocyanins, 8 acylated anthocyanins, and 4 metabolites were present in urine. Mean 24 h excretion of intact anthocyanins increased linearly from 45 (100 g dose) to 65 nmol (300 g dose) for acylated anthocyanins and from 52 (100 g dose) to 79 nmol (300 g dose) for nonacylated anthocyanins.

Longer roasting times resulted in lower amounts of both CGA and CGL. A typical HPLC chromatogram of CGA and CGL present in light medium roasted coffee is shown in Figure 3. Their chemical structures are shown in Figure 4. Arabica cultivars offered the clearest identification and quantification of lactones, except for one case in the Bourbon cultivar, in which pCoQL seemed to coelute with other compound(s). Because Robusta coffee is richer in phenolic compounds than arabica coffee (10, 44, 45), separation of lactones is more difficult due to coelution. The elution order of CGA and CQL was similar to that reported by Schrader et al. (47), who used mass spectrometry, NMR spectroscopy, and LC-MS for characterization. The exception was 3-CQL, which in our column eluted before 5-FQA and 4-FQA. Spiking the samples with synthetic standards and with green coffee extract made it possible to distinguish between CGA and CQL using a reverse phase column with a slightly different selectivity from that used by Schrader et al.

Principal component analysis is performed on the values of the antioxidant activity and the concentrations of the identified phenolic groups in raw, soaked, cooked, and dehydrated flours . Six components were obtained of which the first two accounted for 96% of the total variance. Figure 2 illustrates the graphic representation of the first two components. In the graphic four groups of phenolic compounds (hydroxycinnamides, flavonols, flavones, and flavanones) demonstrate a higher correlation with the antioxidant activity and the raw sample. In this study, flavones and flavanones show the most influence on the antioxidant activity, whereas catechins and procyanidins appeared less associated to this activity; contrary to that reported by Dueñas et al.

This hypothesis is supported by the observation that Asians experience an increase in incidence of these chronic conditions after migrating to the West, suggesting a causal role of environmental factors (Nomura et al., 1978; Ziegler et al., 1993). The strongest protective effect of soy intake was reported for breast, prostate, and colon cancer (Messina et al., 1994; Adlercreutz, 1995; Kurzer and Xu, 1997) and potentially also endometrial cancer (Goodman et al., 1997). Recent case-control studies observed lower endogenous estrogen levels in Japanese women with high soy intake (Nagata et al., 1997) and a 15% reduction in breast cancer risk with every serving of tofu consumed (Wu et al., 1996). The prominent phytochemicals that are believed to contribute to the biological effects observed after soy consumption include isoflavones (Barnes et al., 1994b) and also phytate, saponins, sterols, and protease inhibitors (Messina et al., 1994). The cancer protective effects of isoflavones may be based on their antioxidant (Wei et al., 1995), antiestrogenic (Mousavi and Adlercreutz, 1993; Adlercreutz et al., 1993; Makela et al., 1995; Cassidy et al., 1994), antimutagenic and antiproliferative (Hirano et al., 1994;"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "NONE"}], "meta": {"split": "train", "paper_id": "isoflavone-levels-in-soy-foods-consumed-by-multiethnic-populations-in-singapore-and-hawaii", "chunk_id": "p4", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

Studies of these compounds have revealed they have several pharmacological properties, such as antioxidant activity (11-13), ability to increase hepatic glucose utilization (14-18), inhibition of the HIV-1 integrase (19-21), antispasmodic activity (22), and inhibition of the mutagenicity of carcinogenic compounds (23). In addition, their corresponding chlorogenic acid lactones (CGL), which are formed during the roasting process by the loss of a water molecule from the quinic acid moiety and formation of an intramolecular ester bond (24) , have received special attention due to their potential effects on brain function independent of the pharmacological effects of caffeine (25-31) (Chlorogenic acid and lactones nomenclature: the authors adopted the IUPAC numbering system (36) for chlorogenic acids. Although under IUPAC rules the numbering system for the lactones is different from that of the acids, to avoid confusion, in this paper, the authors used for lactones the same numbering of the carbon atoms as for the acid precursors. When citing other authors, their numbering has been changed for consistency.) De Paulis et al. reported that 3,4dicaffeoylquinic-1,5-lactone (3,4-diCQL) inhibits the human adenosine transporter and could, therefore, potentially counteract the stimulant effect of caffeine in the brain (29). Using rat brain preparations, Boublick et al. reported that coffee exhibits opiate receptor binding activity with characteristics similar to those of opiate antagonists (26). Wynne et al. isolated an active fraction containing isomeric feruloylquinic acid lactones (FQL), which were later identified as 1-FQL, 3-FQL, and 4-FQL (27), based on their spectra. Clifford observed both agonist and antagonist behavior at opioid receptors from fractions known to contain CQL and FQL (28). In a study with cell homogenates expressing the human $\\mu$ opioide receptor (MOR-1), de Paulis et al. (31) confirmed the affinities of synthetic 3-FQL and 4-FQL for MOR-1.

The low antioxidant activity of cereal extracts even at a 5000 ppm level against oxidation of methyl linoleate was also reported by Kahkonen et al. (41). The low TPC in the above study may possibly be due to the inclusion of only free phenolics in the analysis. However, in cereals, phenolic compounds exist primarily in the bound form in association with cell wall materials (10-13, 42-44). The present study also demonstrated the significant contribution of bound phenolic compounds to the TPCs of whole grains, flours, and brans of soft and hard wheats. Thus, it is apparent why cereals could exhibit low TPCs when tested only for their free phenolic acids. A similar conclusion was reached by Dewanto et al. (45) for corn phenolics and dominance of bound phenolics. Sosulski et al. (10) reported that 69.2% of TPCs in wheat was due to insoluble-bound phenolics.

Ellagitannins are polymers of hexahydroxydiphenic acid that can be hydrolyzed to form ellagic acid. Blackberries contain a complex mixture of ellagitannins that range in molecular weight from 302. (ellagic acid) to 3738. (lambertianin D) (4,5). The ellagitannins in black berries are located predominantly in the seeds (4,6), but some are found in the torus (receptacle tissue), and only a few are present in the flesh (4). Several studies have evaluated the ellagitannin content in blackberries with values ranging from 8 to > 70 mg/100 g of FW (7-9). There are no current studies on processed blackberries that report the amount of ellagitannins in their native forms. However, one study (10) reported that ellagic acid in raspberry jam (not hydrolyzed from ellagitannins) increased 2-fold with processing and 3-fold over 6 months of storage, presumably as a result of ellagitannin depolymerization. This suggests that evaluation of native ellagitannin content changes may offer a greater understanding of the potential bioavailability of these phenolics, because they range in molecular weight and number of hexahydroxydiphenic acid moieties."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "blackberries | ellagitannins | 8-70 | mg/100 g FW\nraspberry jam | ellagic acid | 2 | fold increase (processing)\nraspberry jam (6 months storage) | ellagic acid | 3 | fold increase"}], "meta": {"split": "train", "paper_id": "processing-and-storage-effects-on-the-ellagitannin-composition-of-processed-blackberry-products", "chunk_id": "p3", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

With 67% of the original ellagitannin content retained in the presscake, the exclusion of the seeds, where most of the ellagitannins are located (4, 6), accounted for the dramatic losses in ellagitannins in the final product. The concentration of all ellagitannins in the blanched and enzyme-treated mash was 43% greater than that in the frozen fruit, suggesting that the blanching step in combination with the enzyme treatment enhanced the extractability of the ellagitannins, although the other thermal processing treatments discussed previously did not result in increased extractability. According to Rommel and Wrolstad (14), the ellagic acid content of raspberry juices was highly affected by the processing technique, particularly the extent of heating, which dramatically increased total ellagic acid due to enhanced extractability from the cell wall matrix.

The studied compounds identified in our experiment can share a part of that role. As well, many health-beneficial effects of walnut phenolics have also been described (10, 15–17, 30). Much higher contents of phenolics, especially of syringic acid, juglone, and ellagic acid, were observed in the pellicle. In pellicle as well as in kernel the lowest contents of ferulic acid and sinapic acid were found among the identified phenolics, but Rice-Evans et al. (31) found that sinapic acid was the one with higher antioxidative activity, among other phenolic acids (ferulic, caffeic, p-coumaric, syringic, and vanillic acid). Moreover, the study showed differences in the sum of all identified phenolics between the cultivars. The highest differences were observed between Rasna and Fernette fruits; in Rasna there were >2-fold higher contents of identified phenolics in both kernel (the sum was 85. mg/100 g) and pellicle (the sum was 2500. mg/100 g). Gunduc and El (12) reported total phenolics content of up to 7052 mg/kg of walnut kernel.

Thus, there was a positive association between the TPC and the Fe (II) chelation property. When wheat samples were subjected to alkaline hydrolysis, the phenolic aglycons are released and they may participate in Fe(II) chelation. When phenolic acids exist in esterified or bound form, their Fe(II) chelating properties may be hindered.

Because there are considerable changes that can occur to the native ellagitannins (i.e., degradation or depolymerization), the effects of processing on ellagitannin composition and content should also prove valuable to understanding their role in health promotion.

The anthocyanins in corn are mainly located in the aleurone layer and pericarp. Previous work has shown that during nixtamalization of blue corn, most anthocyanins are degraded because of the combined effect of alkaline pH (around 10) and high temperature, which causes structural transformations and breakdown. Increasing the amount of calcium hydroxide in cooking further increases anthocyanin losses. In this study, blue and red corn genotypes showed the highest anthocyanin losses, even though blue corn products still contained the highest absolute anthocyanin contents. On average, anthocyanin losses during lime-cooking, tortilla baking, and tortilla chip frying were 77%, 73%, and 70%, respectively. These values are consistent with earlier reports showing 73–100% loss during nixtamalization. Lime-cooking caused the greatest decrease in anthocyanins, whereas further processing into tortillas and chips did not significantly change anthocyanin levels (p > 0.05)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "corn (blue/red genotypes) | anthocyanins lost during lime-cooking | 77 | % loss\ncorn (blue/red genotypes) | anthocyanins lost during tortilla baking | 73 | % loss\ncorn (blue/red genotypes) | anthocyanins lost during tortilla chip frying | 70 | % loss"}], "meta": {"split": "train", "paper_id": "effect-of-processing-on-the-phytochemical-profiles-and-antioxidant-activity-of-corn-for-production-of-masa-tortillas", "chunk_id": "p40_orig", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

(41) also documented low antioxidant activity from cereal extracts at 5000 ppm in a methyl linoleate system. These low TPC estimates can be explained by analytical protocols that focus solely on free phenolics. In cereal matrices, most phenolic compounds are bound to cell wall materials (10-13, 42-44). The current work demonstrated that these bound phenolics contribute strongly to the TPCs of whole grains, flours, and brans from soft and hard wheats, clarifying why cereals seem to have low TPCs when only free phenolic acids are considered. Dewanto et al. (45) reported analogous results for corn, emphasizing the dominance of bound phenolics. Sosulski et al.

The rapid degradation of (+)-catechin may be explained by enzymatic oxidation, as this ortho-diphenolic compound is shown to be a major substrate for oxidases (14, 41). Even if heat treatment, as in the current experiment, normally will inactivate oxidative enzymes (42), a partially thermostable peroxidase, which has been detected in strawberries (43), may have contributed to the degradation. There was a slight decline in p-coumaroyl glycosides in stored purees made from flesh; that is, the concentration after 16 weeks of storage at 22 °C was 92% of the levels in the purees at production. p-Coumaroyl glycosides in purees containing more achenes were less stable, with 86 and 72% left in purees made from berry homogenate and achene-enriched fraction, respectively. Flavonol content in stored purees increased slightly, but not significantly, when stored at 6 °C. Also, Häkkinen et al.

Kernels from the eight most commonly grown California almonds species (Prunus dulcis) (out of 32 varieties), i.e., Butte, Carmel, Fritz, Mission, Monterey, Nonpareil, Padre, and Price, were provided in raw, whole form by the Almond Board of California. The varieties were collected from across a wide variety of orchards throughout the state and pooled so that no individual orchard was disproportionately represented. The collection process occurred during 2004 and 2005. The almonds were stored in the dark at 4 °C until they were separated into individual aliquots for extraction and analysis. In an industrial setting, water blanching is employed to remove the skin , a process that has the potential to extract substantial amounts of flavonoids. To determine the total flavonoid and phenolic acid content and distribution in the almonds, we analyzed skins, blanch water, and kernels (blanched almonds) separately. Briefly, 100 g of whole almonds was blanched in 175 mL of boiling distilled water for 2. min, a procedure designed to mimic the typical industrial blanching process, and the skins were removed by hand. The volume of blanch water produced from 100 g of almonds was recorded and used to calculate the flavonoid content extracted from the skin. After a cleanup step via centrifugation and filtration through a Millex-HV $0. \\mu m$ filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA), the total phenol content in the samples was determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu reaction. Individual flavonoids were analyzed by highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/electrochemical detection (ECD) using a 16 channel Coulometric Array Detector System (ESA, Inc., Chelmsford, MA.)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "NONE"}], "meta": {"split": "train", "paper_id": "determination-of-flavonoids-and-phenolics-and-their-distribution-in-almonds", "chunk_id": "p7", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

La maggior parte degli studi valuta solo la frazione idrosolubile, nonostante sia noto che anche alcuni lipidi contribuiscono alla prevenzione di patologie da stress ossidativo (7, 33). I dati USDA su un centinaio di alimenti mostrano che i trattamenti termici possono determinare sia incrementi sia cali dell’attività antiossidante, in funzione del tipo e della struttura degli antiossidanti presenti (33). Nel processo mais → masa → tortilla → tortilla chips, ogni passaggio termico modifica la capacità antiossidante complessiva. La frittura per ottenere i tortilla chips è il passaggio più penalizzante: il prodotto finale conserva meno della metà (<50%) dell’attività antiossidante misurata nel grano crudo. Al contrario, la semplice cottura della masa in tortillas può aumentare leggermente l’attività antiossidante, verosimilmente grazie al rilascio di fenoli solubili da matrici legate."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "tortilla chips | antioxidant capacity | <50 | % of raw grain"}], "meta": {"split": "train", "paper_id": "effect-of-processing-on-the-phytochemical-profiles-and-antioxidant-activity-of-corn-for-production-of-masa-tortillas", "chunk_id": "p41_b", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

Ascorbic acids and anthocyanins declined rapidly during storage, whereas other polyphenols and antioxidant activities were more stable; that is, the contributions from anthocyanins and ascorbic acids to TP and antioxidant activities decreased.

However, prodelphinidins are not detected in raw lentils, in contrast to the work of Dueñas et al. (24). Important reductions are observed in the content of these phenols as affected by the industrial dehydration. (+)-Catechin 3-glucoside exhibited the most pronounced decrease (95%), as well as most of procyanidins that were not detected at the end of the industrial process of dehydration. The thermal treatments (cooking and dehydration) would allow degradation reactions of the more polymerized proanthocyanidins, hydrolysis of glycosylated flavonoids, and decomposition of aglycones (10, 29). In general, air-drying at temperatures >60 °C is regarded as unfavorable to efficient extraction of phenolic compounds due to oxidative condensation or decomposition of thermolabile compounds such as (+)-catechins (32)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "raw lentils | catechins + proanthocyanidins | 74. | µg/g\nraw lentils | (+)-catechin 3-glucoside | 39. | µg/g\ndehydrated lentils | (+)-catechin 3-glucoside | 95 | % loss"}], "meta": {"split": "train", "paper_id": "evaluation-of-phenolic-profile-and-antioxidant-properties-of-pardina-lentil-as-affected-by-industrial-dehydration", "chunk_id": "p48", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

Phenolic compounds are usually susceptible to different factors (eg., acidic solution and high temperature) during the extraction process. Drying at temperatures below 50 °C yields the highest amount of total phenolics (58). Drying at room temperature may enhance the enzymatic degradation and thus lower the amount of phenolics in the samples. Increasing the temperature above 60 °C lowered the phenolic amount considerably. At high temperatures, certain phenolics may decompose/combine with the other plant components. Cooking lowered the quercetin content of both tomatoes and onions, with greater reduction being detected following microwaving and boiling than after frying (23). This could be due to flavonoid breakdown during cooking and/or conjugated quercetin being extracted from the tomato and onion tissues by hot water more effectively than with hot oil used in the study. Price et al. (59) found that there are only little gross changes in either the overall level or the composition of quercetin glucosides during normal commercial storage. Boiling and frying do not result in gross changes in glucosides composition, although an overall loss of up to 25% is found for both processes, in the former by leaching into the cooking water and in the latter by thermal degradation into products."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "NONE"}], "meta": {"split": "train", "paper_id": "flavonoid-(myricetin-quercetin-kaempferol-luteolin-and-apigenin)-content-of-edible-tropical-plants", "chunk_id": "p36", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

After 5 min of roasting (~7% weight loss), the levels of 5-CQA had decreased substantially, while the levels of 3-CQA and 4-CQA had increased to twice their original values. This behavior was also observed for FQA. This is evidence that isomerization of CGA takes place at the beginning of roasting, as previously observed by Trugo and Macrae (37) and Leloup et al. (43). In addition, it is possible that partial hydrolysis of diCQA to monoester derivatives occurs in addition to isomerization (43). An initial rise in the total CGA amount was observed at 5 min of roast. This could be a result of the loss of other compounds that are more sensitive to heat, causing a relative increase in levels of the remaining ones.

When the mean values were calculated from these two groups, the levels of total catechins, EGCG, C, and caffeine were 17. and 17.80; 13. and 13.74; 0. and 0.02; and 7. and 7.68/100 mg, respectively . It is surprising to find that the mean levels of these four components are nearly identical. On the other hand, the levels of EGC, EC, and GCG were higher in Japanese green teas, whereas those of ECG, GA, TP, and TB were higher in Chinese green teas. The levels of catechins were found to be extremely high in green tea powder as compared to other traditional green tea products. The green tea powder is a new type of commercial green tea product and is manufactured from fresh tea leaves, which are cultivated during the summer. It has been demonstrated that the tea catechins are higher in the tea leaves grown in summer (Lin et al., 1996).

Data processing was developed in two steps as follows: Data relative to PPs composition as determined by HRGC were processed by PCA, and four principal components were extracted with an explained variance of 66.7% (23. along PC 1, 16. along PC 2, 15. along PC 3, and 11. along PC 4). The loading of each PP on the principal components is reported in Table 5. To detect the importance of derived variables (PCs) on the determination of radical scavenging activity, antioxidant power and stability to oxidation, the PCs were processed by stepwise general leastsquares (SGLSA) multiple regression analysis, SGLSA being aimed at detecting cause-effect relationships. Other authors used SGLSA to study the effect of antioxidants on virgin oil stability (5). To the purpose of this study SGLSA was preferred to PLS, as recommended by other authors for similar investigation (32), because the variables considered in this study were not correlated (principal components are orthogonal for construction). Results of the SGLSA are reported in Table 6.

Total flavonoid content varied up to 31% among sowing times when comparisons were made within each growth stage. The individual flavonoids varied up to 91% (Table 2), which is little compared to the reported 91 fold variation in the isorhamnetin-3-rutinoside content of Diplotaxis tenuifolia between spring (March) and summer (September) harvesting (10). The field season for cv. Emilia spinach in southern Sweden is from May to September, and differences might have been greater if the whole growing season had been monitored in this investigation. Annual fluctuations in radiation, temperature, and other environmental parameters, as well as time of season, are likely to affect these changes. Howard et al. (9) found a higher total phenolic content in spinach harvested in spring than in fall. However, the spinach they harvested in spring was overwintered. Thus, plant age was different between the two harvests, a fact that may also have had an effect on the phenolic content, again showing the difficulty of distinguishing between seasonal variation and ontogenic changes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "NONE"}], "meta": {"split": "test", "paper_id": "flavonoids-in-baby-spinach-(spinacia-oleracea-l-)-changes-during-plant-growth-and-storage", "chunk_id": "p23", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

Effect of the Lipid Content in the Diet on the Urinary Metabolome. Three-way ANOVA showed that 994 variables (18% of the 5587 variables filtered) are significantly affected by the lipid content of the diets, interaction effect with catechin supplementation and sampling time included. Compared to the LF diet (control), 136-295 variables were significantly affected by the increased lipid content of the diets (i.e., with MF and HF diets) in the absence or presence of catechin at either days 17 or 38. From 18 (at day 17 without catechin) to 41% (at day 17 with catechin added) of these variables were commonly affected by MF and HF diets. Sixteen variables were highly correlated (|r| > 0.8) with the lipid content of the diets whatever the sampling time and the presence or absence of catechin. Among all variables affected by the lipid content in the diet, some were tentatively identified by comparing experimental mass with theoretical mass (ΔmDa ≤ 5 mDa) of the metabolites given in HMDB: deoxycytidine (m/z 228), nicotinic acid (m/z 124), 2,4-dihydroxyquinoline (m/z 162) and pipecolinic acid (m/z 130).

Six sugars (fructose, glucose, sucrose, myo-inositol, raffinose, and stachyose), seven organic acids (oxalic, maleic, citric, malic, lactic, succinic, and acetic), and one phenolic acid (gallic acid) were positively identified in natural and roasted hazelnut varieties; among these, sucrose, malic acid, and gallic acid predominated, respectively. Total sugars among hazelnut varieties ranged from 1. to 4. g/100 g, organic acids from 0. to 2. g/100 g, condensed tannins from 3. to 40. mg of catechin equivalents/g, and gallic acid from 0. to 0. mg/100 g.

From the aforementioned data , it seems that the degree of fermentation has a profound effect on the levels of catechins and alkaloids. Because samples of commercial teas have been obtained from different locations, the origins and manufacturing processes of these tea samples are completely unclear. Therefore, we decided to use one species of fresh tea leaves, namely, TTE 12, to study the effect of fermentation process on the levels of these constituents. The results are illustrated in Table 5. The reasons for selecting TTE 12 as starting material are as follows: The tea plant TTE 12 was derived from Camellia sinensis by hybridization at Taiwan Tea Experiment Station in 1981. This hybrid tea species is highly resistant to various insect infections and very productive in leaf yield with moderate tea polyphenol contents; therefore, TTE 12 is now widely cultivated in many tea gardens in Taiwan. In this study, the fermentation processes are carried out by tea-making experts in the Taiwan Tea Experiment Station. The resulting tea products are classified A, B, C, and D according to the degree of fermentation, namely, 0, 10, 25, and 85%, correspondingly. These four classes of tea products are equivalent to the commercial longjing, paochong, oolong, and black teas, respectively. The levels of all catechins including EGCG, EGC, ECG, EC, C, and GCG are progressively reduced during the fermentation process, whereas the level of GA is elevated . The levels of both TP and TB are also progressively reduced, whereas that of caffeine is not changed in the low degree (10-25%) of fermentation but is significantly elevated in the high degree (85%) of fermentation up to 16 mg/ 100 mg . The biochemical mechanism of this elevation is interesting and deserves further investigation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TTE 12 tea (85% fermentation) | caffeine | 16 | mg/100 mg"}], "meta": {"split": "test", "paper_id": "survey-of-catechins-gallic-acid-and-methylxanthines-in-green-oolong-pu-erh-and-black-teas", "chunk_id": "p33", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

Percent retention of individual anthocyanin glycosides varied considerably, with galactosides generally being better retained than arabinosides . Petunidin 3-glucoside, which was a minor constituent, showed the lowest retention. Our results are generally consistent with those of Ichiyanagi et al.

Although the exact mechanism is unclear, it appears that the larger hexose sugar imparts greater resistance to hydrolysis than the smaller pentose sugar."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cultivated blueberries | total anthocyanins | 3866 | mg/kg FW\nblueberry jams (sugar and sugar-free) | total anthocyanins | 79 | % retention vs fresh berries"}], "meta": {"split": "test", "paper_id": "jam-processing-and-storage-effects-on-blueberry-polyphenolics-and-antioxidant-capacity", "chunk_id": "p23", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

The content of gallic acid varied considerably among natural hazelnut varieties, being lowest in Tombul (0. mg/100 g) and highest in Karafındık (0. mg/ 100 g). Significant differences (p < 0.05) existed between natural and roasted hazelnut varieties. Around 66.7% of gallic acid was lost upon roasting . Several factors may affect the gallic acid content upon roasting such as content of gallic acid in the skin, its thermal decomposition, and eventually its liberation from esters, glucosides, and bounded forms. We did not control these processes, but we believe that the broad range of the gallic acid lost in roasted hazelnut varieties could be caused by different contents of this acid in the skin. The hazelnut samples with high levels of loss were probably characterized by the high content of gallic acid in the skins. In contrast, for hazelnut samples with low level of loss, the majority of gallic acid was probably located in the kernels and only heat treatment caused their decreases. Alasalvar et al. (28) did not detect any free phenolics in Tombul hazelnut, but gallic acid, p-coumaric acid, and sinapic acid were found in the esterified form.

For the two anthocyanidins containing arabinose, delphinidin showed greater retention (50%) than malvidin (45%). Our results are generally consistent with those of Tröst et al. (38), who found that cyanidin anthocyanins were the most stable during storage of blueberry-aronia nectar, followed by peonidin, petunidin, delphinidin, and malvidin, the only discrepancy being that we found delphinidin to be more stable than peonidin. In comparing similar anthocyanidins with different sugars attached, we observed that galactosides were more stable than arabinosides. The mean percent retentions of the galactosides and arabinosides of delphinidin following 6 months of storage were 59 and 50%, respectively, and the mean percent retentions of the galactosides and arabinosides of malvidin were 52 and 45%, respectively. Tröst et al. (38) also reported that anthocyanin galactosides in blueberry—aronia nectars were more stable over storage than arabinosides, but they found glucosides to be the most stable glycoside. We detected only one glucoside in our study, petunidin 3-glucoside, which showed the lowest mean percent retention (20%) after 6 months of storage, but was present at very low concentrations compared to the other anthocyanin glycosides. Although some of the apparent losses of individual anthocyanins during storage were actually due to the formation of anthocyanin-procyanidin polymers, further losses may result from hydrolytic reactions resulting in conversion of anthocyanin glycosides to chalcones, which spontaneously degrade into phenolic acids and aldehydes (39). We also cannot rule out the possibility that heat-stable forms of polyphenol oxidase or peroxidase played a role in the degradation of anthocyanins. Further research is needed to identify the mechanisms responsible for anthocyanin degradation during storage."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "blueberry jam (6 months storage) | cyanidin galactosides | 65 | % retention\nblueberry jam (6 months storage) | delphinidin galactosides | 59 | % retention\nblueberry jam (6 months storage) | peonidin galactosides | 55 | % retention\nblueberry jam (6 months storage) | malvidin galactosides | 52 | % retention\nblueberry jam (6 months storage) | delphinidin arabinosides | 50 | % retention\nblueberry jam (6 months storage) | malvidin arabinosides | 45 | % retention\nblueberry jam (6 months storage) | petunidin 3-glucoside | 20 | % retention"}], "meta": {"split": "test", "paper_id": "jam-processing-and-storage-effects-on-blueberry-polyphenolics-and-antioxidant-capacity", "chunk_id": "p36", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

Different kinds of pharmacological effects such as protection of blood vessels, reduction of serum cholesterol levels, and prevention of arteriosclerosis were reported as integrated effects (Cheng et al., 1988). The major active principles of tea have been identified as catechins.

Ellagitannins were converted by acid hydrolysis to ellagic acid and a less polar derivative, 20-26% of the content, which was assumed to be a methoxylated ellagic acid formed by the electrophilic attack of methanol to unsubstituted carbons in an intermediate structure (25). It should be noted that in previous studies ellagic acid was quantified as one conversion product (14, 26, 30). The contents of ellagitannins as gallic acid equivalents and ellagic acid equivalents in the methanol extracts were comparable in the berries of Rubus species but not in strawberries (Table 3). The possible explanation is that the fibrous berry matrix of the strawberries, which was partly solubilized in methanol, may contain insoluble or extensive, unresolved ellagitannins. Our results on the total contents of ellagitannins were similar to those where soluble forms were extracted with 70% acetone and quantified using ellagic acid as a standard (4). The estimated intake of ellagic acid should sum up free and conjugated forms of ellagic acid as well as soluble and insoluble ellagitannins. According to our results, these contents (mg/kg in fresh weight) would be approximately 650-850 in strawberries, 1900 in cultivated raspberries, 2700 in wild raspberries, 3900 in arctic bramble, and 3600 in cloudberries.

The effects of shredding and subsequent exposure to light on both the level and composition of the flavonoids in the eight varieties of lettuce are shown in Table 4. Significant losses in the total flavonol content were found for the green and red oak leaf (94 and 43%, respectively), iceberg (36%), green batavia (25%), and lollo biondo and rosso varieties (24 and 6%, respectively). The large loss of flavonoid (94%) observed for green oak leaf corresponded to a visible amount of tissue degradation, which was not seen in the other varieties. Significant losses of the malonated forms of both quercetin glucoside and cyanidin glucoside were not matched on a quantitative basis by a corresponding increase in the glucoside, and these losses did not result in the formation of the respective aglycons."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "green oak leaf lettuce | total flavonols | 94 | % loss after shredding and light exposure\nred oak leaf lettuce | total flavonols | 43 | % loss after shredding and light exposure\niceberg lettuce | total flavonols | 36 | % loss after shredding and light exposure\ngreen batavia lettuce | total flavonols | 25 | % loss after shredding and light exposure\nlollo biondo lettuce | total flavonols | 24 | % loss after shredding and light exposure\nlollo rosso lettuce | total flavonols | 6 | % loss after shredding and light exposure"}], "meta": {"split": "test", "paper_id": "effect-of-variety-processing-and-storage-on-the-flavonoid-glycoside-content-and-composition-of-lettuce-and-endive", "chunk_id": "p34", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

Final data processing by PCA was obtained by subtracting three non significant variables (i.e., $K{270}$ , $\\Delta K$ , p-anisidine value) from the initial matrix. Results are reported in Figure 2 (loading plot) and Figure 3 (score plot) with an explained variance of 85.4%, of which 58.6% was along the first principal component (PC 1) and 26.8% was along PC 2. On the basis of the distribution of the virgin oil samples, it is possible to assume that product with high TPP content and characterized by polyphenols with high antioxidant activity (higher QE<sub>0</sub>) generally showed low peroxide and Totox values. Moreover, the antioxidant activity of polyphenol extracts showed to be positively correlated with the oxidative stability as measured with Rancimat (r = 0.810, p < 0.001; r = 0.808, p< 0.001; for RSA and AOP, respectively). These results, which are in agreement with those of Mannino et al. (14), confirm the importance of polyphenols content in the improvement of oxidative stability of olive oils (6, 8, 9). With regard to this subject, it is noteworthy that TPP content showed a higher correlation coefficient than antioxidant activity indices with oxidative stability of oil (r = 0.904, p < 0.001)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "NONE"}], "meta": {"split": "test", "paper_id": "contribution-of-the-phenolic-fraction-to-the-antioxidant-activity-and-oxidative-stability-of-olive-oil", "chunk_id": "p31", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

AX has high water holding capacity , which is influenced by the solubility and structural features of the polymer . Water-extractable (WE) AX affected loaf volume and crumb structure of rye bread positively, whereas waterunextractable (WUE) AX showed negative effects on these parameters . The AX consists of a linear backbone of 1,4-linked β-D-xylopyranose units with L-arabinofuranosyl residues attached to this main chain by 1,3- and/or 1,2-α-glycosidic linkages . The arabinofuranoside units of AX are partly ester-linked at the O-5-position to ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid or other phenolic acids . During grain development adjacent AX chains are partly linked together through dimerisation of ferulic acids. Rye bran contains at least four different forms of ferulic acid dehydrodimers . Structurally, cereal AX represents a very heterogeneous group, in which the ratio of arabinose to xylose, the pattern of arabinose substitution, the feruloyl group content and the degree of polymerisation can vary significantly ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "NONE"}], "meta": {"split": "val", "paper_id": "s00217-001-0417-6", "chunk_id": "p10", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

Food ingredients based on soy, such as defatted flour, protein concentrates, and protein isolates are used in the preparation of products directed to vegetarians and milkintolerant subjects. The latter group also includes infants with severe or mild physiological dysfunctions, such as milk protein allergies, postdiarrhoea lactose intolerance, galactosemia, and primary lactase deficiency. In addition, great impulse to the consumption of soy foods has been given by the acceptance of the US Food and Drug Administration of the claim that consuming 25 g soybean proteins per day is useful for preventing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), based on the available data on the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in hypercholesterolemic subjects [2–4]. This activity depends on the soybean proteins per se [5–7] and in particular on the a<sup>0</sup> subunit of the 7S globulins .

A positive linear relationship between total phenolics and antioxidant capacity was observed in spinach. However, the relationship between total phenolics and ORAC in spinach was less pronounced than the highly linear relationship observed between total phenolics and ORAC in blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries (9, 11). The lower correlation observed between these variables could be explained by the complex flavonoid composition of spinach. Only two of the flavonoid compounds (1 and 3) in spinach showed significant free radical scavenging activity against the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (15). Both of the patuletin derivatives have a 3',4'dihydroxyl grouping, an important structural feature known to increase the free-radical scavenging capacity of flavonoids (18). Interestingly, the two patuletin derivatives, compounds 1 and 3, correlated highly with ORAC in our study ( $r{xy} = 0.74$ and 0.71, respectively), which indirectly corroborates their contribution to antioxidant capacity. Our results concerning the relationship between total phenolics, flavonoids, and ORAC are also consistent with those of Guo et al. (33), who found that electroactive components in spinach extracts determined by HPLC coupled with coulometric array detection did not correlate with ORAC as well as electroactive components measured in other fruits and vegetables. Thus, it appears that although spinach is a rich source of flavonoids, only compounds with a 3',4'-dihydroxyl grouping, which accounted for only 22% of the total flavonoid content, show significant free radical scavenging capacity. Besides flavonoids, other water-soluble compounds not measured in the study could also contribute significantly to ORAC. Isomers of p-coumaric acid and uridine extracted from spinach leaves are reported to be potent inhibitors of linoleic acid autoxidation (34)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "NONE"}], "meta": {"split": "val", "paper_id": "antioxidant-capacity-and-phenolic-content-of-spinach-as-affected-by-genetics-and-growing-season", "chunk_id": "p30", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

Plant-derived polyphenolic flavonoids exhibit numerous biological and pharmacological properties (16-18) that could potentially afford protection against chronic diseases. Spinach flavonols, in particular, have been shown to possess antioxidant (15, 19), antiinflammatory (20, 21), antimutagenic (22), and anticarcinogenic (23) properties.

The median of total phenols content was 38 ppm (as syringic acid), although a wide range was observed, from 11 to 76 ppm. The main phenols found were the dialdehydic form of elenolic acid linked to tyrosol (p-HPEA-EDA; $9 \\pm 7$ ppm, as median and interquartile range), oleuropein aglycon ( $8 \\pm 6$ ppm), and the dialdehydic form of elenolic acid linked to hydroxytyrosol (3,4-DHPEA-EDA; $5\\pm8$ ppm).

The relative increase in the water-extractability of DF during dough mixing was probably caused by the solubilisation of WUE DF components. The decrease in the total DF content can be explained by breakdown of WE DF components to smaller molecules which were no longer precipitated by 80% ethanol and thus not counted as DF by the method used. No changes in water extractability were measured during dough proofing. However, this does not exclude the possibility that some breakdown of AX to lower molecular weight polymers could have occurred during this processing step.

Activities of α-amylase, β-xylosidase, α-arabinofuranosidase, and cinnamoyl esterase(s) were found in extracts of wholemeal and in dough after mixing and proofing, whereas activity of endo-xylanase was only found in the wholemeal. As a result of dough mixing, the content of total DF decreased by 21%, which was caused by a decrease in the amount of water-unextractable (WUE) DF. The content of water-extractable (WE) DF was unchanged during the bread-making process, but the relative content of WE DF increased. The content of total ester-bound phenolic acids and ferulic acid dehydrodimers decreased from 1575 µg/g in the wholemeal to 1472 µg/g in rye bread.

Thus, the changes of ORAC values could be attributed to the leaching of phenolic compounds into the soaking and cooking water.

About 40 mg of psoralen administered orally, combined with UVA light, is referred to as PUVA therapy. LFCs have been used clinically to treat skin disorders such as vitiligo and prurigo nodularis and have been proposed as a treatment for jet lag. Psoralens have been used to determine the structure and function of DNAs and RNAs because of their reactivity with these compounds . Briefly, LFCs are known to intercalate into DNA and form covalent bonds in the presence of UVA light (320–400 nm). LFCs are found in a wide variety of plants in the Apiaceae, Rutaeae, and Moraceae (Gray and Waterman, 1978; Berenbaum, 1981; Murray et al., 1982; Matern et al., 1988; Zobel and Brown, 1990).

The high temperature of the roasting process causes a breakage of the carbon-carbon bonds of CGA, resulting in isomerization and degradation. After 5 min of roasting (~7% weight loss), the levels of 5-CQA had decreased substantially, while the levels of 3-CQA and 4-CQA had increased to twice their original values. This behavior was also observed for FQA. This is evidence that isomerization of CGA takes place at the beginning of roasting, as previously observed by Trugo and Macrae (37) and Leloup et al. (43). In addition, it is possible that partial hydrolysis of diCQA to monoester derivatives occurs in addition to isomerization (43). An initial rise in the total CGA amount was observed at 5 min of roast. This could be a result of the loss of other compounds that are more sensitive to heat, causing a relative increase in levels of the remaining ones. Longer periods of roasting resulted in a loss of total CGA.

Moderate intake of both wine and beer was associated with lower relative risk for cardiovascular diseases. The risk was more notable with the intake of wine. For all causes of mortality, only daily wine intake (22–32 g of alcohol) was associated with a lower risk due to lower incidence of cardiovascular diseases and cancers, and it was concluded that moderate consumption of only wine was associated with a lower all-cause mortality. Attention turned to the nonalcoholic fractions of wine, and particularly red wine, as an relevant source of polyphenols, which are capable of inhibiting the processes behind CAD. This hypothesis is supported by the results of recent epidemiological studies concerning foodstuff polyphenols, particularly flavonoids. A correlation was also noticed among increasing levels of flavonoid ingestion from fruit and vegetables and reduction in CAD. The studies carried out by Hertog et al. (7), Knekt et al.

It was clear that the plasma appearance rate of each anthocyanin in the mixture was found to be remarkably different depending on the type of sugar attached and also on the aglycone structure, more correctly, the B ring structures of the aglycone . All of the anthocyanins reached the maximum plasma level at 15 or 30 min after oral administration suggesting that anthocyanins were effectively absorbed from the stomach as well as from the small intestine, as reported elsewhere (32, 42-44). Because contents of each anthocyanin in original bilberry extract were different as shown in Table 1, the plasma concentration profile of each anthocyanin after normalization by the administered dose is given in Figure 4. When the values for the anthocyanins carrying the same aglycone were compared, galactosides clearly reported higher values than those of glucosides and arabinosides except malvidin . On the other hand, when the anthocyanins carrying the same sugar moiety were compared, differences among the aglycones were not marked, although cyanidin and delphinidin-glycosides reported rather higher values than the O-methyl analogues, malvidin and petunidin, but peonidin 3-O-β-D-galactoside was exceptional, which reported the highest values among all anthocyanins."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "NONE"}], "meta": {"split": "train", "paper_id": "bioavailability-and-tissue-distribution-of-anthocyanins-in-bilberry-(vaccinium-myrtillus-l-)-extract-in-rats", "chunk_id": "p34_aug46", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

The biological importance and activities of these compounds have been reviewed (Beier and Nigg, 1992). Briefly, LFCs are known to intercalate into DNA and form covalent bonds in the presence of UVA light (320–400 nm). Psoralens have been used to determine the structure and function of DNAs and RNAs because of their reactivity with these compounds . LFCs have been used clinically to treat skin disorders such as vitiligo and prurigo nodularis and have been proposed as a treatment for jet lag. About 40 mg of psoralen administered orally, combined with UVA light, is referred to as PUVA therapy.

Since local plant material (black carrot, Germany) was abundant, roots were harvested at four different sites of the experimental plots at different stages, beginning at the end of August and ending mid-October, thus allowing the evaluation of the infra-specific variability of anthocyanin accumulation as well as of the influence of harvest date on pigment concentration of the roots. The total anthocyanin contents depending on harvest time are presented in Fig. 3. Most obviously, pigment contents within the same cultivar are subject to great variation, especially for the second, third and fourth harvest date. In general, maximal total anthocyanin contents were observed between mid-September and October. The pigment pattern showed only minor differences throughout this period. The average proportion of acylated compounds ranged from 80. (end of August) to 84.8% (mid-October), without showing notable differences. The same observations were made for the proportion of the predominant compound cyanidin feruloylxylosylglucosylgalactoside."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "NONE"}], "meta": {"split": "train", "paper_id": "s00217-004-0976-4", "chunk_id": "p26_aug53", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

The bilberry extract was orally or intravenously administered to rats, and the plasma levels of each anthocyanin were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. As the result, all anthocyanins except peonidin 3-O-α-L-arabinoside were detectable in the blood plasma. The plasma concentration of anthocyanins as a whole reached the maximum level of 1. $\\mu$ M at 15 min after oral administration of 400 mg/kg bilberry extract (153. mg/kg as anthocyanins) and then decreased with time. Uptake and decay profiles of each anthocyanin in the plasma were almost the same for all anthocyanins except a few with their maximum after 30 min. Among the anthocyanins carrying the same aglycone, the plasma level after 15 min of oral administration was as follows: galactoside > glucoside > arabinoside. Plasma clearance of anthocyanins after intravenous administration clearly showed that arabinoside disappeared more rapidly than glucoside and galactoside. On the other hand, when anthocyanins carrying the same sugar moiety were compared, the half disappearance time of plasma anthocyanins was in the following order: delphinidin > cyanidin > petunidin = peonidin > malvidin. The bioavailability of anthocyanins was in the range of 0.61-1.82% and was 0.93% as the anthocyanin mixture. The bioavailability of anthocyanins carrying the same aglycone was in the following order: Galactoside showed the highest followed by glucoside and arabinoside for cyanidin and delphinidin, but arabinoside and galactoside showed a higher bioavailability than glucoside for petunidin and malvidin. Anthocyanins recovered in urine and bile during the first 4 h after intravenous administration were only 30. and 13.4%, respectively. Anthocyanin profiles in tissues were quite different from those in blood plasma.

Studies of these compounds have revealed they have several pharmacological properties, such as antioxidant activity (11-13), ability to increase hepatic glucose utilization (14-18), inhibition of the HIV-1 integrase (19-21), antispasmodic activity (22), and inhibition of the mutagenicity of carcinogenic compounds (23). In addition, their corresponding chlorogenic acid lactones , which are formed during the roasting process by the loss of a water molecule from the quinic acid moiety and formation of an intramolecular ester bond (24) , have received special attention due to their potential effects on brain function independent of the pharmacological effects of caffeine (25-31) (Chlorogenic acid and lactones nomenclature: the authors adopted the IUPAC numbering system (36) for chlorogenic acids. Although under IUPAC rules the numbering system for the lactones is different from that of the acids, to avoid confusion, in this paper, the authors used for lactones the same numbering of the carbon atoms as for the acid precursors. When citing other authors, their numbering has been changed for consistency.) De Paulis et al. reported that 3,4dicaffeoylquinic-1,5-lactone (3,4-diCQL) inhibits the human adenosine transporter and could, therefore, potentially counteract the stimulant effect of caffeine in the brain (29). Using rat brain preparations, Boublick et al. reported that coffee exhibits opiate receptor binding activity with characteristics similar to those of opiate antagonists (26). Wynne et al. isolated an active fraction containing isomeric feruloylquinic acid lactones , which were later identified as 1-FQL, 3-FQL, and 4-FQL (27), based on their spectra. Clifford observed both agonist and antagonist behavior at opioid receptors from fractions known to contain CQL and FQL (28).

Sample preparation for HPLC analysis of anthocyanins from biological samples was followed using our previously reported method (34, 35). Briefly, the plasma samples (300 µL) were applied to Sep-Pak C18 cartridges light preconditioned with MeOH (3 mL) and 3% TFA aqueous solution (3 mL). Then, the cartridges were washed successively with 3 mL of 3% TFA aqueous solution, dichloromethane, and benzene (3 mL each). Anthocyanins were eluted with 50% acetonitrile containing 1% TFA aqueous solution. The recovered anthocyanins were evaporated to dryness in vacuo at a temperature below 40 °C and dissolved in 150 µL of distilled water containing 0.5% TFA, and then, an aliquot (100 µL) of the solutions was injected into an HPLC system (Hitachi 7200). In the case of intravenous administered plasma samples, further dilution was carried out depending on the color of the samples. Urine and bile samples were prepared as described above using Sep-Pak C18 cartridges Environment . All of the washing and elution procedures were carried out using 10 mL of the solvent. HPLC was carried out on a Develosil ODS HG-5 column (Nomura Chemical Co. Ltd., Japan, 150 mm × 1. mm) using 18% MeOH containing 0.5% TFA as the elution solvent at a flow rate of 0. mL/min, and the elution peaks were monitored at 520 nm with a UV-visible detector (Hitachi, Japan). The recovery of anthocyanins through the above method was checked using Bilberon 25, and it was determined as 87.5%. A calibration curve for each anthocyanin was made using purified anthocyanidin-glycoside (3-O-glycopyranoside of delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, peonidin, and malvidin) as the reference. The anthocyanin metabolites were quantified as cyanidin 3-Oâ-D-glucoside equivalent."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "NONE"}], "meta": {"split": "train", "paper_id": "bioavailability-and-tissue-distribution-of-anthocyanins-in-bilberry-(vaccinium-myrtillus-l-)-extract-in-rats", "chunk_id": "p14_aug68", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

It is interesting that the spectra of raw garlic and red onion have specific bands in the range of molecular masses from 50 to 112 kDa that disappeared after heat treatment . The boiling procedure for more than 20 min caused degradation of the proteins in studied vegetables. The 14 kDa bands in raw garlic and onions during electrophoretic separation without reduction had more proteins than the treated samples. The 50, 70, 77, 100, 102, and 112 kDa bands disappeared after treatment, probably as less stable proteins in these vegetables. Literature data indicate that the superoxide dismutase antioxidant activities during boiling, microwaving, and baking were diminished for garlic by about 86, 96, and 90% and for onions by about 60, 77, and 26%, respectively (37), describing the changes of amino acid composition during processing (36).

This hypothesis is supported by the observation that Asians experience an increase in incidence of these chronic conditions after migrating to the West, suggesting a causal role of environmental factors . The strongest protective effect of soy intake was reported for breast, prostate, and colon cancer (Messina et al., 1994; Adlercreutz, 1995; Kurzer and Xu, 1997) and potentially also endometrial cancer . Recent case-control studies observed lower endogenous estrogen levels in Japanese women with high soy intake and a 15% reduction in breast cancer risk with every serving of tofu consumed . The prominent phytochemicals that are believed to contribute to the biological effects observed after soy consumption include isoflavones (Barnes et al., 1994b) and also phytate, saponins, sterols, and protease inhibitors . The cancer protective effects of isoflavones may be based on their antioxidant , antiestrogenic (Mousavi and Adlercreutz, 1993; Adlercreutz et al., 1993; Makela et al., 1995; Cassidy et al., 1994), antimutagenic and antiproliferative (Hirano et al., 1994;"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "NONE"}], "meta": {"split": "train", "paper_id": "isoflavone-levels-in-soy-foods-consumed-by-multiethnic-populations-in-singapore-and-hawaii", "chunk_id": "p4_aug96", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

The contribution from bound phenolics of hard and soft wheat brans was >84%. The PCL assay is based on temporary inhibition of a photoinduced, superoxide radical anion-mediated chemiluminescence originating from the oxidation of luminol (35). In the presence of an antioxidant, chemiluminescence may be delayed and the resulting integral in the ACL system is indicative of the radical scavenging potential of the compound. The method is quite sensitive and hence allows detection of low concentrations of antioxidants relative to a reference compound (54).

Drying at temperatures below 50 °C yields the highest amount of total phenolics (58). This could be due to flavonoid breakdown during cooking and/or conjugated quercetin being extracted from the tomato and onion tissues by hot water more effectively than with hot oil used in the study. Increasing the temperature above 60 °C lowered the phenolic amount considerably. Drying at room temperature may enhance the enzymatic degradation and thus lower the amount of phenolics in the samples. Price et al. At high temperatures, certain phenolics may decompose/combine with the other plant components. Cooking lowered the quercetin content of both tomatoes and onions, with greater reduction being detected following microwaving and boiling than after frying (23). (59) found that there are only little gross changes in either the overall level or the composition of quercetin glucosides during normal commercial storage. Phenolic compounds are usually susceptible to different factors (eg., acidic solution and high temperature) during the extraction process.

The anthocyanin contents of the original raw and cooked pinto and black beans are presented in Table 3. Anthocyanins were not detectable in the raw and cooked pinto beans. Five anthocyanins, namely, delphinidin-3-glucoside, malvidin-3,5-diglucoside, petunidin-3-glucoside, malvidin-3-galactoside, and malvidin-3-glucoside, were detected in the raw black beans. The dominant components were delphinidin-3-glucoside, malvidin-3,5-diglucoside, petunidin-3-glucoside, and malvidin-3-glucoside. These findings are in accordance with those of Takeoka et al. (5 ) and Wu and Prior (35 ), who found that delphinidin-3-glucoside, petunidin-3-glucoside, and malvidin-3-glucoside were the major anthocyanins in black common beans. The discrepancy was that malvidin-3,5-diglucoside as the third major component after delphinidin-3-glucoside and petunidin-3-glucoside was detected in our pinto bean sample at a higher content than malvidin-3 glucoside. However, malvidin-3,5-diglucoside was reported as the minor anthocyanin in black beans in previous studies (5, 35).

Because contents of each anthocyanin in original bilberry extract were different as shown in Table 1, the plasma concentration profile of each anthocyanin after normalization by the administered dose is given in Figure 4. It was clear that the plasma appearance rate of each anthocyanin in the mixture was found to be remarkably different depending on the type of sugar attached and also on the aglycone structure, more correctly, the B ring structures of the aglycone . All of the anthocyanins reached the maximum plasma level at 15 or 30 min after oral administration suggesting that anthocyanins were effectively absorbed from the stomach as well as from the small intestine, as reported elsewhere (32, 42-44). On the other hand, when the anthocyanins carrying the same sugar moiety were compared, differences among the aglycones were not marked, although cyanidin and delphinidin-glycosides showed rather higher values than the O-methyl analogues, malvidin and petunidin, but peonidin 3-O-β-D-galactoside was exceptional, which showed the highest values among all anthocyanins."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "NONE"}], "meta": {"split": "train", "paper_id": "bioavailability-and-tissue-distribution-of-anthocyanins-in-bilberry-(vaccinium-myrtillus-l-)-extract-in-rats", "chunk_id": "p34_aug165", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

For all causes of mortality, only daily wine intake (22–32 g of alcohol) was associated with a lower risk due to lower incidence of cardiovascular diseases and cancers, and it was concluded that moderate consumption of only wine was associated with a lower all-cause mortality. Attention turned to the nonalcoholic fractions of wine, and particularly red wine, as an important source of polyphenols, which are capable of inhibiting the processes behind CAD. This hypothesis is supported by the results of recent epidemiological studies concerning foodstuff polyphenols, particularly flavonoids. A correlation was also noticed between increasing levels of flavonoid ingestion from fruit and vegetables and reduction in CAD. The studies carried out by Hertog et al. (7), Knekt et al.

The almonds were stored in the dark at 4 °C until they were separated into individual aliquots for extraction and analysis. The varieties were collected from across a wide variety of orchards throughout the state and pooled so that no individual orchard was disproportionately represented. Kernels from the eight most commonly grown California almonds species (Prunus dulcis) (out of 32 varieties), i.e., Butte, Carmel, Fritz, Mission, Monterey, Nonpareil, Padre, and Price, were provided in raw, whole form by the Almond Board of California. To determine the total flavonoid and phenolic acid content and distribution in the almonds, we analyzed skins, blanch water, and kernels (blanched almonds) separately. The volume of blanch water produced from 100 g of almonds was recorded and used to calculate the flavonoid content extracted from the skin. In an industrial setting, water blanching is employed to remove the skin , a process that has the potential to extract substantial amounts of flavonoids.

Sample preparation for HPLC analysis of anthocyanins from biological samples was followed using our previously reported method (34, 35). Briefly, the plasma samples (300 µL) were applied to Sep-Pak C18 cartridges light preconditioned with MeOH (3 mL) and 3% TFA aqueous solution (3 mL). Then, the cartridges were washed successively with 3 mL of 3% TFA aqueous solution, dichloromethane, and benzene (3 mL each). Anthocyanins were eluted with 50% acetonitrile containing 1% TFA aqueous solution. The recovered anthocyanins were evaporated to dryness in vacuo at a temperature below 40 °C and dissolved in 150 µL of distilled water containing 0.5% TFA, and then, an aliquot (100 µL) of the solutions was injected into an HPLC system (Hitachi 7200). In the case of intravenous administered plasma samples, further dilution was carried out depending on the color of the samples. Urine and bile samples were prepared as described above using Sep-Pak C18 cartridges Environment . All of the washing and elution procedures were carried out using 10 mL of the solvent. HPLC was carried out on a Develosil ODS HG-5 column (Nomura Chemical Co. Ltd., Japan, 150 mm × 1. mm) using 18% MeOH containing 0.5% TFA as the elution solvent at a flow rate of 0. mL/min, and the elution peaks were monitored at 520 nm with a UV-visible detector (Hitachi, Japan). The recovery of anthocyanins through the above method was checked using Bilberon 25, and it was determined as 87.5%. A calibration curve for each anthocyanin was made using purified anthocyanidin-glycoside (3-O-glycopyranoside of delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, peonidin, and malvidin) as the reference.

For all causes of mortality, only daily wine intake (22–32 g of alcohol) was associated with a lower risk due to lower incidence of cardiovascular diseases and cancers, and it was concluded that moderate consumption of only wine was associated with a lower all-cause mortality. Attention turned to the nonalcoholic fractions of wine, and particularly red wine, as an relevant source of polyphenols, which are capable of inhibiting the processes behind CAD. This hypothesis is supported by the results of recent epidemiological studies concerning foodstuff polyphenols, particularly flavonoids. A correlation was also noticed between increasing levels of flavonoid ingestion from fruit and vegetables and reduction in CAD. The studies carried out by Hertog et al. (7), Knekt et al.

In addition, it is possible that partial hydrolysis of diCQA to monoester derivatives occurs in addition to isomerization (43). Longer periods of roasting resulted in a loss of total CGA. This could be a result of the loss of other compounds that are more sensitive to heat, causing a relative increase in levels of the remaining ones. (43). This is evidence that isomerization of CGA takes place at the beginning of roasting, as previously observed by Trugo and Macrae (37) and Leloup et al. After 5 min of roasting (~7% weight loss), the levels of 5-CQA had decreased substantially, while the levels of 3-CQA and 4-CQA had increased to twice their original values. The high temperature of the roasting process causes a breakage of the carbon-carbon bonds of CGA, resulting in isomerization and degradation. An initial rise in the total CGA amount was observed at 5 min of roast. This behavior was also observed for FQA.

The hydroxycinnamic compounds are mainly constituents of the cell wall, in various bonds and esterified forms, linked to arabinoxylans and lignin.

This group included hydroxycinnamic compounds in free forms (trans-p-coumaric and cis-p-coumaric acid) and those linked to other compounds (hydroxyacids) . In general terms, these compounds decrease with thermal treatment, except the trans-p-coumaric acid derivative. The loss of these components could be either due to leaching or diffusion of these phenols into soaking and cooking water or due to the breakdown of phenolics during processing (10).

Because contents of each anthocyanin in original bilberry extract were different as shown in Table 1, the plasma concentration profile of each anthocyanin after normalization by the administered dose is given in Figure 4. All of the anthocyanins reached the maximum plasma level at 15 or 30 min after oral administration suggesting that anthocyanins were effectively absorbed from the stomach as well as from the small intestine, as reported elsewhere (32, 42-44). To evaluate the absorption efficiency of each anthocyanin, the anthocyanin concentrations in blood plasma after 15 min of oral administration were normalized by the orally administered dose of each anthocyanin in Bilberon 25 and the results ( $C{15\\text{min}}/\\text{dose}$ ) are shown in Figure 3. It was clear that the plasma appearance rate of each anthocyanin in the mixture was found to be remarkably different depending on the type of sugar attached and also on the aglycone structure, more correctly, the B ring structures of the aglycone . On the other hand, when the anthocyanins carrying the same sugar moiety were compared, differences among the aglycones were not marked, although cyanidin and delphinidin-glycosides reported rather higher values than the O-methyl analogues, malvidin and petunidin, but peonidin 3-O-β-D-galactoside was exceptional, which reported the highest values among all anthocyanins."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "NONE"}], "meta": {"split": "train", "paper_id": "bioavailability-and-tissue-distribution-of-anthocyanins-in-bilberry-(vaccinium-myrtillus-l-)-extract-in-rats", "chunk_id": "p34_aug214", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

Thus, the changes of ORAC values could be attributed to the leaching of phenolic compounds into the soaking and cooking water. nevertheless, other phenomena such as better solubility of antioxidant nonphenolic compounds following thermal treatment and the formation of Maillard products with was elevated free radical scavenging properties may be involved (41)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "NONE"}], "meta": {"split": "train", "paper_id": "evaluation-of-phenolic-profile-and-antioxidant-properties-of-pardina-lentil-as-affected-by-industrial-dehydration", "chunk_id": "p58_x15", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

A reversed-phase Nova-Pak C18 ( $300 \\times 3. \\text{ mm}$ i.d., $4 \\mu\\text{m}$ ) column and a Nova-Pak C18 ( $10 \\times 3. \\text{ mm}$ i.d., $4 \\mu\\text{m}$ ) guard column (Waters, Barcelona, Spain) were used. Solvents that constituted the mobile phase were acetic acid/water, 10:90, v/v (A), and methanol (B). The elution conditions applied were as follows: 0–10 min, 0% B isocratic; 10–40 min, linear gradient from 0 to 15% B; 40–60 min, 15% B isocratic; and finally, washing and reconditioning of the column. The flow rate was $0. \\text{ mL min}^{-1}$ , and the injection volume was $50 \\mu\\text{L}$ for the crude extracts or $10 \\mu\\text{L}$ for the thiolysis media. The chromatographic separation was carried out at $25 ^\\circ\\text{C}$ . Catechins and dihydrochalcones were monitored and quantified at $280 \\text{ nm}$ , hydroxycinnamic acids at $320 \\text{ nm}$ , flavonols at $370 \\text{ nm}$ , and anthocyanins at $530 \\text{ nm}$ . Polyphenol identification was achieved by comparison of their retention times and their UV-visible spectra with those of the standards that were available. Some other chromatographic peaks were assigned to a particular polyphenol class according to their UV-visible spectra and bibliographic sources. In this sense, those unknown chromatographic peaks that exhibit flavan-3-ol spectra were appointed as CAT-n, and those with a spectrum of 5-caffeoylquinic acid as CAA-n, of p-coumaric as CMA-n, of dihydrochalcone as PLD-n, of flavonol as QG-n and of anthocyanin as CG-n (where n is a number). Quantification was performed by reporting the measured integration areas in the calibration equation of the corresponding standards. Thus, procyanidin B2 and the unknown flavan-3-ols were quantified as (+)-catechin, phloretin 2'-O-xyloglucoside and the unknown dihydrochalcones as phloridzin, avicularin and the unknown flavonols as rutin, CAA-n species as 5-caffeoylquinic acid, 4-p-coumaroylquinic acid and CMA-n species as p-coumaric acid, and the unknown anthocyanins as ideain."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "NONE"}], "meta": {"split": "train", "paper_id": "polyphenolic-profiles-of-basque-cider-apple-cultivars-and-their-technological-properties", "chunk_id": "p14_x32", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

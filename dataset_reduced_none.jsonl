Malic, galacturonic, levulinic, succinic, citric, oxalic, acetic, and butyric acids were present in 12 varieties of hazelnuts, malic acid being the most abundant (ranging from 42 to 209 mg/100 g, dry weight basis). Galacturonic, levulinic, and butyric acids were not detected in Tombul hazelnut in this work. Recently, Cristofori et al. (17) identified three organic acids (namely, malic, citric, and succinic) in 24 Italian and foreign hazelnut cultivars and found that the total content ranged from 0. g/100 g in Tombul to 0. g/100 g (dry weight basis) in Gunslebert. Malic acid was the predominant organic acid, ranging from 0. to 0. g/100 g (dry weight"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "NONE"}], "meta": {"split": "test", "paper_id": "effects-of-roasting-on-taste-active-compounds-of-turkish-hazelnut-varieties-(corylus-avellana-l-)", "chunk_id": "p23", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

Their contents varied in different samples collected from different cities in China and Japan. When the mean values were calculated from these two groups, the levels of total catechins, EGCG, C, and caffeine were 17. and 17.80; 13. and 13.74; 0. and 0.02; and 7. and 7.68/100 mg, respectively . It is surprising to find that the mean levels of these four components are nearly identical. On the other hand, the levels of EGC, EC, and GCG were higher in Japanese green teas, whereas those of ECG, GA, TP, and TB were higher in Chinese green teas. The levels of catechins were found to be extremely high in green tea powder as compared to other traditional green tea products. The green tea powder is a new type of commercial green tea product and is manufactured from fresh tea leaves, which are cultivated during the summer. It has been demonstrated that the tea catechins are higher in the tea leaves grown in summer (Lin et al., 1996). This finding suggests that green tea powder could be the product of choice for human consumption in the future."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chinese green teas (mean) | catechins (total) | 17. | mg/100 mg\nJapanese green teas (mean) | catechins (total) | 17.80 | mg/100 mg\nChinese green teas (mean) | EGCG | 13. | mg/100 mg\nJapanese green teas (mean) | EGCG | 13.74 | mg/100 mg\nChinese green teas (mean) | catechin (C) | 0. | mg/100 mg\nJapanese green teas (mean) | catechin (C) | 0.02 | mg/100 mg\nChinese green teas (mean) | caffeine | 7. | mg/100 mg\nJapanese green teas (mean) | caffeine | 7.68 | mg/100 mg"}], "meta": {"split": "test", "paper_id": "survey-of-catechins-gallic-acid-and-methylxanthines-in-green-oolong-pu-erh-and-black-teas", "chunk_id": "p25", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

Data processing was developed in two steps as follows: Data relative to PPs composition as determined by HRGC were processed by PCA, and four principal components were extracted with an explained variance of 66.7% (23. along PC 1, 16. along PC 2, 15. along PC 3, and 11. along PC 4). The loading of each PP on the principal components is reported in Table 5. To detect the importance of derived variables (PCs) on the determination of radical scavenging activity, antioxidant power and stability to oxidation, the PCs were processed by stepwise general leastsquares (SGLSA) multiple regression analysis, SGLSA being aimed at detecting cause-effect relationships. Other authors used SGLSA to study the effect of antioxidants on virgin oil stability (5). To the purpose of this study SGLSA was preferred to PLS, as recommended by other authors for similar investigation (32), because the variables considered in this study were not correlated (principal components are orthogonal for construction). Results of the SGLSA are reported in Table 6. The most significant variables were found to be PC 2 and PC 3, which are positively correlated with RSA. 3′4′-DHPEA-EA weighed on PC 2, while syryingic acid and p-cumaric acid weighed on PC 3.

Total flavonoid content varied up to 31% among sowing times when comparisons were made within each growth stage. The individual flavonoids varied up to 91% (Table 2), which is little compared to the reported 91 fold variation in the isorhamnetin-3-rutinoside content of Diplotaxis tenuifolia between spring (March) and summer (September) harvesting (10). The field season for cv. Emilia spinach in southern Sweden is from May to September, and differences might have been greater if the whole growing season had been monitored in this investigation. Annual fluctuations in radiation, temperature, and other environmental parameters, as well as time of season, are likely to affect these changes. Howard et al. (9) found a higher total phenolic content in spinach harvested in spring than in fall. However, the spinach they harvested in spring was overwintered. Thus, plant age was different between the two harvests, a fact that may also have had an effect on the phenolic content, again showing the difficulty of distinguishing between seasonal variation and ontogenic changes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "NONE"}], "meta": {"split": "test", "paper_id": "flavonoids-in-baby-spinach-(spinacia-oleracea-l-)-changes-during-plant-growth-and-storage", "chunk_id": "p23", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

Effect of the Lipid Content in the Diet on the Urinary Metabolome. Three-way ANOVA showed that 994 variables (18% of the 5587 variables filtered) are significantly affected by the lipid content of the diets, interaction effect with catechin supplementation and sampling time included. Compared to the LF diet (control), 136-295 variables were significantly affected by the increased lipid content of the diets (i.e., with MF and HF diets) in the absence or presence of catechin at either days 17 or 38. From 18 (at day 17 without catechin) to 41% (at day 17 with catechin added) of these variables were commonly affected by MF and HF diets. Sixteen variables were highly correlated (|r| > 0.8) with the lipid content of the diets whatever the sampling time and the presence or absence of catechin. Among all variables affected by the lipid content in the diet, some were tentatively identified by comparing experimental mass with theoretical mass (ΔmDa ≤ 5 mDa) of the metabolites given in HMDB: deoxycytidine (m/z 228), nicotinic acid (m/z 124), 2,4-dihydroxyquinoline (m/z 162) and pipecolinic acid (m/z 130).

Six sugars (fructose, glucose, sucrose, myo-inositol, raffinose, and stachyose), seven organic acids (oxalic, maleic, citric, malic, lactic, succinic, and acetic), and one phenolic acid (gallic acid) were positively identified in natural and roasted hazelnut varieties; among these, sucrose, malic acid, and gallic acid predominated, respectively. Total sugars among hazelnut varieties ranged from 1. to 4. g/100 g, organic acids from 0. to 2. g/100 g, condensed tannins from 3. to 40. mg of catechin equivalents/g, and gallic acid from 0. to 0. mg/100 g.

From the aforementioned data , it seems that the degree of fermentation has a profound effect on the levels of catechins and alkaloids. Because samples of commercial teas have been obtained from different locations, the origins and manufacturing processes of these tea samples are completely unclear. Therefore, we decided to use one species of fresh tea leaves, namely, TTE 12, to study the effect of fermentation process on the levels of these constituents. The results are illustrated in Table 5. The reasons for selecting TTE 12 as starting material are as follows: The tea plant TTE 12 was derived from Camellia sinensis by hybridization at Taiwan Tea Experiment Station in 1981. This hybrid tea species is highly resistant to various insect infections and very productive in leaf yield with moderate tea polyphenol contents; therefore, TTE 12 is now widely cultivated in many tea gardens in Taiwan. In this study, the fermentation processes are carried out by tea-making experts in the Taiwan Tea Experiment Station. The resulting tea products are classified A, B, C, and D according to the degree of fermentation, namely, 0, 10, 25, and 85%, correspondingly. These four classes of tea products are equivalent to the commercial longjing, paochong, oolong, and black teas, respectively. The levels of all catechins including EGCG, EGC, ECG, EC, C, and GCG are progressively reduced during the fermentation process, whereas the level of GA is elevated . The levels of both TP and TB are also progressively reduced, whereas that of caffeine is not changed in the low degree (10-25%) of fermentation but is significantly elevated in the high degree (85%) of fermentation up to 16 mg/ 100 mg . The biochemical mechanism of this elevation is interesting and deserves further investigation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TTE 12 tea (85% fermentation) | caffeine | 16 | mg/100 mg"}], "meta": {"split": "test", "paper_id": "survey-of-catechins-gallic-acid-and-methylxanthines-in-green-oolong-pu-erh-and-black-teas", "chunk_id": "p33", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

Percent retention of individual anthocyanin glycosides varied considerably, with galactosides generally being better retained than arabinosides . Petunidin 3-glucoside, which was a minor constituent, showed the lowest retention. Our results are generally consistent with those of Ichiyanagi et al.

Although the exact mechanism is unclear, it appears that the larger hexose sugar imparts greater resistance to hydrolysis than the smaller pentose sugar."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cultivated blueberries | total anthocyanins | 3866 | mg/kg FW\nblueberry jams (sugar and sugar-free) | total anthocyanins | 79 | % retention vs fresh berries"}], "meta": {"split": "test", "paper_id": "jam-processing-and-storage-effects-on-blueberry-polyphenolics-and-antioxidant-capacity", "chunk_id": "p23", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

The content of gallic acid varied considerably among natural hazelnut varieties, being lowest in Tombul (0. mg/100 g) and highest in Karafındık (0. mg/ 100 g). Significant differences (p < 0.05) existed between natural and roasted hazelnut varieties. Around 66.7% of gallic acid was lost upon roasting . Several factors may affect the gallic acid content upon roasting such as content of gallic acid in the skin, its thermal decomposition, and eventually its liberation from esters, glucosides, and bounded forms. We did not control these processes, but we believe that the broad range of the gallic acid lost in roasted hazelnut varieties could be caused by different contents of this acid in the skin. The hazelnut samples with high levels of loss were probably characterized by the high content of gallic acid in the skins. In contrast, for hazelnut samples with low level of loss, the majority of gallic acid was probably located in the kernels and only heat treatment caused their decreases. Alasalvar et al. (28) did not detect any free phenolics in Tombul hazelnut, but gallic acid, p-coumaric acid, and sinapic acid were found in the esterified form.

For the two anthocyanidins containing arabinose, delphinidin showed greater retention (50%) than malvidin (45%). Our results are generally consistent with those of Tröst et al. (38), who found that cyanidin anthocyanins were the most stable during storage of blueberry-aronia nectar, followed by peonidin, petunidin, delphinidin, and malvidin, the only discrepancy being that we found delphinidin to be more stable than peonidin. In comparing similar anthocyanidins with different sugars attached, we observed that galactosides were more stable than arabinosides. The mean percent retentions of the galactosides and arabinosides of delphinidin following 6 months of storage were 59 and 50%, respectively, and the mean percent retentions of the galactosides and arabinosides of malvidin were 52 and 45%, respectively. Tröst et al. (38) also reported that anthocyanin galactosides in blueberry—aronia nectars were more stable over storage than arabinosides, but they found glucosides to be the most stable glycoside. We detected only one glucoside in our study, petunidin 3-glucoside, which showed the lowest mean percent retention (20%) after 6 months of storage, but was present at very low concentrations compared to the other anthocyanin glycosides. Although some of the apparent losses of individual anthocyanins during storage were actually due to the formation of anthocyanin-procyanidin polymers, further losses may result from hydrolytic reactions resulting in conversion of anthocyanin glycosides to chalcones, which spontaneously degrade into phenolic acids and aldehydes (39). We also cannot rule out the possibility that heat-stable forms of polyphenol oxidase or peroxidase played a role in the degradation of anthocyanins. Further research is needed to identify the mechanisms responsible for anthocyanin degradation during storage."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "blueberry jam (6 months storage) | cyanidin galactosides | 65 | % retention\nblueberry jam (6 months storage) | delphinidin galactosides | 59 | % retention\nblueberry jam (6 months storage) | peonidin galactosides | 55 | % retention\nblueberry jam (6 months storage) | malvidin galactosides | 52 | % retention\nblueberry jam (6 months storage) | delphinidin arabinosides | 50 | % retention\nblueberry jam (6 months storage) | malvidin arabinosides | 45 | % retention\nblueberry jam (6 months storage) | petunidin 3-glucoside | 20 | % retention"}], "meta": {"split": "test", "paper_id": "jam-processing-and-storage-effects-on-blueberry-polyphenolics-and-antioxidant-capacity", "chunk_id": "p36", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

Different kinds of pharmacological effects such as protection of blood vessels, reduction of serum cholesterol levels, and prevention of arteriosclerosis were reported as integrated effects (Cheng et al., 1988). The major active principles of tea have been identified as catechins.

Ellagitannins were converted by acid hydrolysis to ellagic acid and a less polar derivative, 20-26% of the content, which was assumed to be a methoxylated ellagic acid formed by the electrophilic attack of methanol to unsubstituted carbons in an intermediate structure (25). It should be noted that in previous studies ellagic acid was quantified as one conversion product (14, 26, 30). The contents of ellagitannins as gallic acid equivalents and ellagic acid equivalents in the methanol extracts were comparable in the berries of Rubus species but not in strawberries (Table 3). The possible explanation is that the fibrous berry matrix of the strawberries, which was partly solubilized in methanol, may contain insoluble or extensive, unresolved ellagitannins. Our results on the total contents of ellagitannins were similar to those where soluble forms were extracted with 70% acetone and quantified using ellagic acid as a standard (4). The estimated intake of ellagic acid should sum up free and conjugated forms of ellagic acid as well as soluble and insoluble ellagitannins. According to our results, these contents (mg/kg in fresh weight) would be approximately 650-850 in strawberries, 1900 in cultivated raspberries, 2700 in wild raspberries, 3900 in arctic bramble, and 3600 in cloudberries.

The effects of shredding and subsequent exposure to light on both the level and composition of the flavonoids in the eight varieties of lettuce are shown in Table 4. Significant losses in the total flavonol content were found for the green and red oak leaf (94 and 43%, respectively), iceberg (36%), green batavia (25%), and lollo biondo and rosso varieties (24 and 6%, respectively). The large loss of flavonoid (94%) observed for green oak leaf corresponded to a visible amount of tissue degradation, which was not seen in the other varieties. Significant losses of the malonated forms of both quercetin glucoside and cyanidin glucoside were not matched on a quantitative basis by a corresponding increase in the glucoside, and these losses did not result in the formation of the respective aglycons."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "green oak leaf lettuce | total flavonols | 94 | % loss after shredding and light exposure\nred oak leaf lettuce | total flavonols | 43 | % loss after shredding and light exposure\niceberg lettuce | total flavonols | 36 | % loss after shredding and light exposure\ngreen batavia lettuce | total flavonols | 25 | % loss after shredding and light exposure\nlollo biondo lettuce | total flavonols | 24 | % loss after shredding and light exposure\nlollo rosso lettuce | total flavonols | 6 | % loss after shredding and light exposure"}], "meta": {"split": "test", "paper_id": "effect-of-variety-processing-and-storage-on-the-flavonoid-glycoside-content-and-composition-of-lettuce-and-endive", "chunk_id": "p34", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

Final data processing by PCA was obtained by subtracting three non significant variables (i.e., $K{270}$ , $\\Delta K$ , p-anisidine value) from the initial matrix. Results are reported in Figure 2 (loading plot) and Figure 3 (score plot) with an explained variance of 85.4%, of which 58.6% was along the first principal component (PC 1) and 26.8% was along PC 2. On the basis of the distribution of the virgin oil samples, it is possible to assume that product with high TPP content and characterized by polyphenols with high antioxidant activity (higher QE<sub>0</sub>) generally showed low peroxide and Totox values. Moreover, the antioxidant activity of polyphenol extracts showed to be positively correlated with the oxidative stability as measured with Rancimat (r = 0.810, p < 0.001; r = 0.808, p< 0.001; for RSA and AOP, respectively). These results, which are in agreement with those of Mannino et al. (14), confirm the importance of polyphenols content in the improvement of oxidative stability of olive oils (6, 8, 9). With regard to this subject, it is noteworthy that TPP content showed a higher correlation coefficient than antioxidant activity indices with oxidative stability of oil (r = 0.904, p < 0.001)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "NONE"}], "meta": {"split": "test", "paper_id": "contribution-of-the-phenolic-fraction-to-the-antioxidant-activity-and-oxidative-stability-of-olive-oil", "chunk_id": "p31", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

Ferulic acid is one of the major phenolics ingested by humans. It is well-known that ferulic acid is absorbed in the duodenum or small intestine (17). Adom et al. (5) compared concentrations of ferulic acid in corn, wheat, oats, and rice and reported that corn had the highest amount (906 µmol/100 g of grain). Dewanto et al. (8) found that the bound ferulic acid in sweet corn was liberated in higher amounts by prolonged processing, a tendency that agrees with results obtained in this work. We found, among all corn genotypes studied, that approximately 97% of the ferulic acid was in bound form, in agreement with other authors (5-7, <sup>15</sup>, <sup>25</sup>, <sup>29</sup>). High amounts of bound ferulic acid in raw kernels were lost during lime-cooking. The bound ferulic acid was concentrated in the aleurone layer and pericarp tissue removed during cooking and steeping. The increase of free ferulic acid can be justified by the fact that heat processing and lime-cooking liberate transferulic acid from bound ester glycosides mainly associated with cell walls (16). Tortillas and tortilla chips contained higher amounts of bound ferulic acid than the masa, indicating that the heat processes of baking and frying complexed ferulic acid."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "corn | ferulic acid | 906 | µmol/100 g grain\ncorn | bound ferulic acid | 97 | % of total ferulic acid"}], "meta": {"split": "train", "paper_id": "effect-of-processing-on-the-phytochemical-profiles-and-antioxidant-activity-of-corn-for-production-of-masa-tortillas", "chunk_id": "p39", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

These properties allow raw garlic and onions and their preparations to successfully treat and prevent a wide range of diseases, such as cardiovascular, cancer, and others (5, 6). The published literature deals with the organosulfur compounds of garlic (4, 7–10), although there is an interest in fructans and anthocyanin pigments (11, 12). The highest quantity of fructans is found in garlic, artichoke, shallots, leek bulb, and onions and ranged from 1. to 17. g/100 g of fresh weight (FW) (11). In the case of onions both organosulfur compounds and flavonoids such as quercetin are significant bioactive compounds (1, 6, 13, 14). Despite low amounts of polyphenols in investigated vegetables, especially in garlic (4, 7, 10, 15, 16), the current study focused on the antioxidants, which are mostly composed of polyphenols."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "NONE"}], "meta": {"split": "train", "paper_id": "comparison-of-the-main-bioactive-compounds-and-antioxidant-activities-in-garlic-and-white-and-red-onions-after", "chunk_id": "p3", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

Bressani and Elias (28 ) observed that about 30-40% of phenolics could be removed from common beans by cooking and discarding the cooking water. In the present study, it was found that about 63- 77% of TPC, 67-84% of TFC, 32-54% of CTC, and 0-100% of MAC were reduced in pinto beans. Both regular boiling and pressure boiling lost much more TPC (about 71-77%) than steaming treatments in pinto beans. In the case of black beans, about 61-74% of TPC, 61-79% of TFC, 68-73% CTC, and 88-100% MAC losses were found in thermal-processed black beans. In addition, boiling treatment reduced more TPC and TFC than steaming processing. Pressure steaming reduced more TPC, TFC, CTC, and MAC values than regular steaming. These results on the variations of TPC by processing are in good agreement with those reported by Ismail et al. (29 ), who found that thermal treatment decreased the TPC in all vegetables. These results also exhibited trends similar to those of our previous papers (9, 11, 24), in which we showed that thermal processing lost 50-70% of TPC in peas, 70-80% of TPC in black common beans, and 43-63% of TPC in black soybean. These significant losses might be attributed to those water-soluble phenolics that were leached into soaking and cooking water before and during thermal processing as well as the breakdown of phenolics during processing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "pinto beans (thermal processing) | total phenolics (TPC) loss | 63-77 | %\npinto beans (thermal processing) | total flavonoids (TFC) loss | 67-84 | %\npinto beans (thermal processing) | condensed tannins (CTC) loss | 32-54 | %\npinto beans (thermal processing) | monomeric anthocyanins (MAC) loss | 0-100 | %\nblack beans (thermal processing) | total phenolics (TPC) loss | 61-74 | %\nblack beans (thermal processing) | total flavonoids (TFC) loss | 61-79 | %\nblack beans (thermal processing) | condensed tannins (CTC) loss | 68-73 | %\nblack beans (thermal processing) | monomeric anthocyanins (MAC) loss | 88-100 | %"}], "meta": {"split": "train", "paper_id": "total-phenolic-phenolic-acid-anthocyanin-flavan-3-ol-and-flavonol-profiles-and-antioxidant-properties-of-pinto-and", "chunk_id": "p34", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

Supplements presented an exception; they had highly variable ratios of isoflavones. In contrast to total isoflavones, conjugation patterns in all soy foods were highly variable between and even within food groups. Glucosyl malonates are the predominant conjugate in the soybean seed (Kudou et al., 1991). We found the highest ratio of this conjugate (65–72%) in unprocessed soybean and its seeds, particularly when stored frozen, and in soy flours . Boiling soybeans for 1 h resulted in an 8% decrease in glucosyl malonates and a concomitant increase in 6% and each 1% of glucosides, acetyl-glucosides, and aglycons, respectively, whereas tau pok (fried and pressed tofu) showed the highest ratio of acetyl glucosides (24%).

After 5 min of roasting (~7% weight loss), the levels of 5-CQA had decreased substantially, while the levels of 3-CQA and 4-CQA had increased to twice their original values. This behavior was also observed for FQA. This is evidence that isomerization of CGA takes place at the beginning of roasting, as previously observed by Trugo and Macrae (37) and Leloup et al. (43). In addition, it is possible that partial hydrolysis of diCQA to monoester derivatives occurs in addition to isomerization (43). An initial rise in the total CGA amount was observed at 5 min of roast. This could be a result of the loss of other compounds that are more sensitive to heat, causing a relative increase in levels of the remaining ones.

The bilberry extract was orally or intravenously administered to rats, and the plasma levels of each anthocyanin were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. As the result, all anthocyanins except peonidin 3-O-α-L-arabinoside were detectable in the blood plasma. The plasma concentration of anthocyanins as a whole reached the maximum level of 1. $\\mu$ M at 15 min after oral administration of 400 mg/kg bilberry extract (153. mg/kg as anthocyanins) and then decreased with time. Uptake and decay profiles of each anthocyanin in the plasma were almost the same for all anthocyanins except a few with their maximum after 30 min. Among the anthocyanins carrying the same aglycone, the plasma level after 15 min of oral administration was as follows: galactoside > glucoside > arabinoside. Plasma clearance of anthocyanins after intravenous administration clearly showed that arabinoside disappeared more rapidly than glucoside and galactoside. On the other hand, when anthocyanins carrying the same sugar moiety were compared, the half disappearance time of plasma anthocyanins was in the following order: delphinidin > cyanidin > petunidin = peonidin > malvidin. The bioavailability of anthocyanins was in the range of 0.61-1.82% and was 0.93% as the anthocyanin mixture. The bioavailability of anthocyanins carrying the same aglycone was in the following order: Galactoside showed the highest followed by glucoside and arabinoside for cyanidin and delphinidin, but arabinoside and galactoside showed a higher bioavailability than glucoside for petunidin and malvidin. Anthocyanins recovered in urine and bile during the first 4 h after intravenous administration were only 30. and 13.4%, respectively. Anthocyanin profiles in tissues were quite different from those in blood plasma.

The concentrations of ellagic acid and (+)-catechin were 20% higher in the purees than in the berries. In raspberries, the content of free ellagic acid increased 2-fold with processing to jam (16). The increase of ellagic acid may be explained by release of ellagic acid after hydrolysis of the ellagitannins present.

The anthocyanins in corn are mainly located in the aleurone layer and pericarp (28). Salinas-Moreno et al. (28) found that during the nixtamalization of blue corn a majority of anthocyanins were degraded. The synergistic effect of the alkaline pH (approximately 10) and temperature caused important structure transformation or modifications. Cortes et al. (26) compared the anthocyanins of corn cooked with different amounts of lime and concluded that increasing concentrations of calcium hydroxide increased anthocyanin losses. Table 3 clearly shows that anthocyanins losses were higher in the blue and red corn genotypes. Blue corn products contained the highest anthocyanin content. Our results showed that losses varied according to the type of corn; the average losses of anthocyanins during sequential steps of lime-cooking, tortilla baking, and tortilla chip frying were 77, 73, and 70%, respectively, consistent with data from Salinas et al. (28), who found losses from 73 to 100% during nixtamalization. Results clearly showed that limecooking had the highest negative effect on anthocyanin losses.

After 8 weeks at 6 °C, total anthocyanin content was between 73 and 84% of the content in the purees at production. After 16 weeks, the content had decreased to 56-64% of the initial values. After storage at room temperature for 8 and 16 weeks, total anthocyanin contents in the purees were 13-24 and 5-11% of the initial values, respectively. A higher retention of total anthocyanins was observed in strawberry jam stored at 20 °C for 9. weeks (33-47%), whereas retention (6-9%) similar to that in the purees in the present study was observed after about 17 weeks of storage (37). The decay of pelargonidin-3-glucoside, the main anthocyanin in strawberry purees (initially 78%), was similar to that of total anthocyanins. Pelargonidin-3-malonylglucoside was the least stable among the anthocyanins in the strawberry purees. Under storage at 22 °C, only 9-16 and 3-5% of the pelargonidin-3-malonylglucoside were left after 8 and 16 weeks, respectively. Significant demalonation has also previously been observed for malonyl esters of flavonoid glycosides (38). It is worth noting that the amount of 5-carboxypyranopelargonidin-3-glucoside, present in minor amounts in strawberry puree at production (averaging 0.6% of total anthocyanins), increased in purees made from berry homogenate and achene-enriched fraction during storage and contributed 3-4 and 7-10% of total anthocyanins in strawberry purees stored at 22 °C in 8 and 16 weeks, respectively. The higher stability of the pyrano form may be explained by the restricted formation of the unstable, colorless equilibrium forms reported for ordinary anthocyanins (31). The degradation of anthocyanins was lower in purees with higher achene levels. When initially more anthocyanins were present in purees made from flesh, this relationship changed during storage. The increased stability observed when the purees contained more achenes could be caused by stabilization of compounds originating from the achenes, probably ellagic acid-containing compounds, or could be due to the lower content of ascorbic acid, known to accelerate anthocyanin decay (39, 40)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "strawberry puree (6 °C, 8 weeks) | anthocyanins (total) | 73-84 | % of initial\nstrawberry puree (6 °C, 16 weeks) | anthocyanins (total) | 56-64 | % of initial\nstrawberry puree (22 °C, 8 weeks) | anthocyanins (total) | 13-24 | % of initial\nstrawberry puree (22 °C, 16 weeks) | anthocyanins (total) | 5-11 | % of initial\nstrawberry puree (22 °C, 8 weeks) | pelargonidin-3-malonylglucoside | 9-16 | % of initial\nstrawberry puree (22 °C, 16 weeks) | pelargonidin-3-malonylglucoside | 3-5 | % of initial\nstrawberry puree (22 °C, 8 weeks) | 5-carboxypyranopelargonidin-3-glucoside | 3-4 | % of total anthocyanins\nstrawberry puree (22 °C, 16 weeks) | 5-carboxypyranopelargonidin-3-glucoside | 7-10 | % of total anthocyanins"}], "meta": {"split": "train", "paper_id": "polyphenol-composition-and-antioxidant-activity-in-strawberry-purees-impact-of-achene-level-and-storage", "chunk_id": "p45", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

In a previous study, the combined levels of myricetin and quercetin in Californian red wines were found to vary from 6. to 25. mg $L^{-1}$ (Frankel et al., 1995). Red wines contain sizable amounts of free myricetin and quercetin, typically 20–50% of the total flavonol content . This is in marked contrast to grapes (Stewart and Crozier, unpublished data), other fruits, and vegetables, as well as beverages such as tea, in which conjugated flavonols dominate and aglycons are present, at best, in only trace amounts (Herrmann, 1988; Hertog et al., 1992a, 1993b; Crozier et al., 1997b). Typically, free flavonols are much more active than their conjugated derivatives in both antioxidant and anti-platelet aggregation assays [see Frankel et al. (1995), Vinson et al. (1995)], and this may be a contributory factor in explaining the protective effects of red wine against cardiovascular disease. Although preliminary reports are beginning to appear in the literature on the flavonol content of plasma and urine (Hollman et al., 1995, 1996), there is still a dearth of detailed information on the effectiveness with which different conjugated flavonols, and their aglycons, are absorbed and the extent to which they are subsequently metabolized. Ultimately, the degree of protection afforded by red wines, as well as fruits, vegetables, and other beverages, will be determined by (i) the efficiency with which the different types of potential antioxidants are absorbed, (ii) their form and residence time in the blood and relevant tissues, and (iii) the resultant in vivo biological activity."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "red wines | flavonols (total) | 4-41 | mg/L\nCalifornian red wines | myricetin + quercetin (combined) | 6-25 | mg/L\nred wines | free myricetin + quercetin | 20-50 | % of total flavonols"}], "meta": {"split": "train", "paper_id": "survey-of-the-free-and-conjugated-myricetin-and-quercetin-content-of-red-wines-of-different-geographical-origins", "chunk_id": "p39", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

Few studies have investigated the antioxidant activity of foods exerted by intrinsic hydrophilic and lipophilic chemical components. Most antioxidant research has focused on determining the antioxidant activity of watersoluble food extracts, in spite of the role of some lipid components on the prevention of some stress-oxidative diseases (7, 33). There are limited data on processing effects; data from the USDA on 100 different sorts of foods showed that the cooking process can increase or decrease the antioxidant activity of foods depending on the nature and molecular structure of the antioxidant compound (33). The sequential heat treatments of lime-cooking, tortilla baking, and tortilla chip frying affected the antioxidant activity. Deep-fat frying had the most detrimental effect on antioxidant capacity because tortilla chips contained <50% of the antioxidant capacity of the raw grain. Baking masa into tortillas slightly increased the antioxidant capacity, likely due to increased soluble phenolics from bound phytochemicals."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "tortilla chips | antioxidant capacity | <50 | % of raw grain"}], "meta": {"split": "train", "paper_id": "effect-of-processing-on-the-phytochemical-profiles-and-antioxidant-activity-of-corn-for-production-of-masa-tortillas", "chunk_id": "p41", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

Several studies have investigated phenolic composition of cereals, especially wheat, barley, and corn (5-7, <sup>9</sup>, 15, 23). These studies demonstrated that most of the phenolics were bound or attached to cell wall structures. Our results in the present study agree with previous investigations and confirmed that >80% of total phenolics were in bound form. Table 1 clearly shows that lime-cooking caused important losses of phenolic compounds that leached into the steep liquor or nejayote. It is well-known that nixtamalization modifies proteins and enhances calcium uptake (12, 16) and that the calcium hydroxide hydrolyzes fiber components located in the pericarp, aleurone cell wall, and endosperm cell walls. Most of the ferulic acid is associated with the corn bran or pericarp (24). Gonzalez et al. (24) found that the alkaline treatment of corn partially hydrolyzes the hemicelullose and lignin fractions rich in phenolics. The chemical hydrolysis releases and solubilizes phenolics that leach into the cooking liquor. Baking of masa to obtain tortillas and frying of tortillas to yield chips had a slight effect on the phenolic concentration and composition. Only the free phenolics slightly increased when masa was transformed into tortillas and chips. The study of Dewanto et al. (8) showed there were significant increases in the content of total free phenolics following thermal treatment with time, which is consistent with the data of this work. Unlike free phenolic content, the concentration of bound phenolics decreased when raw corn was processed into tortillas and chips."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "corn | bound phenolics | >80 | % of total phenolics"}], "meta": {"split": "train", "paper_id": "effect-of-processing-on-the-phytochemical-profiles-and-antioxidant-activity-of-corn-for-production-of-masa-tortillas", "chunk_id": "p37", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

Bourbon; C. arabica cv. Longberry; and C. canephora cv. Robusta. Individual CGL levels were determined by comparison of HPLC peaks with those of synthetic CGL standards. Seven CGL were identified: 3-caffeoylquinic-1,5-lactone (3-CQL), 4- caffeoylquinic-1,5-lactone (4-CQL), 3-coumaroylquinic-1,5-lactone (3-pCoQL), 4-coumaroylquinic-1,5-lactone (4-pCoQL), 3-feruloylquinic-1,5-lactone (3-FQL), 4-feruloylquinic-1,5lactone (4-FQL), and 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic-1,5-lactone (3,4-diCQL). 3-CQL was the most abundant lactone in C. arabica and C. canephora, reaching peak values of $230 \\pm 9$ and $254 \\pm 4$ mg/100 g (dry weight), respectively, at light medium roast (~14% weight loss). 4-CQL was the second most abundant lactone (116 $\\pm$ 3 and 139 $\\pm$ 2 mg/100 g, respectively.

Analyses were done using a high-performance liquid chromatograph equipped with a diode array detector. Significant differences in the contents of identified phenolics were observed among cultivars. Phenolics were determined separately in the kernel and in the thin skin of the walnut, termed the pellicle. Not only in the kernel but also in the pellicle did syringic acid, juglone, and ellagic acid predominate (average values of 33.83, 11.75, and 5. mg/100 g of kernel; and 1003.24, 317.90, and 128. mg/100 g of pellicle, respectively), and the contents of ferulic and sinapic acid (average values of 0. and 0. mg/100 g of kernel and 2. and 2. mg/100 g of pellicle, respectively) were the lowest in all cultivars. The highest differences in the sum of all identified phenolics were observed between Rasna and Fernette fruits; in Rasna there were >2-fold higher contents of identified phenolics in both kernel and pellicle. It was found that the walnut pellicle is the most important source of walnut phenolics. The ratio between the contents in pellicle and kernel varied by at least 14.8-fold for caffeic acid (cv. Adams) and by up to 752.0-fold for p-coumaric acid (cv. Elit)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "walnut kernel | syringic acid | 33.83 | mg/100 g\nwalnut kernel | juglone | 11.75 | mg/100 g\nwalnut kernel | ellagic acid | 5. | mg/100 g\nwalnut kernel | ferulic acid | 0. | mg/100 g\nwalnut kernel | sinapic acid | 0. | mg/100 g\nwalnut pellicle | syringic acid | 1003.24 | mg/100 g\nwalnut pellicle | juglone | 317.90 | mg/100 g\nwalnut pellicle | ellagic acid | 128. | mg/100 g\nwalnut pellicle | ferulic acid | 2. | mg/100 g\nwalnut pellicle | sinapic acid | 2. | mg/100 g"}], "meta": {"split": "train", "paper_id": "phenolic-acids-syringaldehyde-and-juglone-in-fruits-of-different-cultivars-of-juglans-regia-l", "chunk_id": "p1", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

Moderate intake of both wine and beer was associated with lower relative risk for cardiovascular diseases. The risk was more significant with the intake of wine. For all causes of mortality, only daily wine intake (22–32 g of alcohol) was associated with a lower risk due to lower incidence of cardiovascular diseases and cancers, and it was concluded that moderate consumption of only wine was associated with a lower all-cause mortality. Attention turned to the nonalcoholic fractions of wine, and particularly red wine, as an important source of polyphenols, which are capable of inhibiting the processes behind CAD. This hypothesis is supported by the results of recent epidemiological studies concerning foodstuff polyphenols, particularly flavonoids. A correlation was also noticed between increasing levels of flavonoid ingestion from fruit and vegetables and reduction in CAD. The studies carried out by Hertog et al. (7), Knekt et al.

After 16 weeks at 22 °C, 0. mg/100 g of fw, averaging 28% of the start levels, remained in the purees. The rapid degradation of (+)-catechin may be explained by enzymatic oxidation, as this ortho-diphenolic compound is shown to be a major substrate for oxidases (14, 41). Even if heat treatment, as in the current experiment, normally will inactivate oxidative enzymes (42), a partially thermostable peroxidase, which has been detected in strawberries (43), may have contributed to the degradation. There was a slight decline in p-coumaroyl glycosides in stored purees made from flesh; that is, the concentration after 16 weeks of storage at 22 °C was 92% of the levels in the purees at production. p-Coumaroyl glycosides in purees containing more achenes were less stable, with 86 and 72% left in purees made from berry homogenate and achene-enriched fraction, respectively. Flavonol content in stored purees increased slightly, but not significantly, when stored at 6 °C. Also, Häkkinen et al.

The loss of liquid due to draining of canned products by consumers may be a source of losses in ellagitannins, but even with increased ellagitannin content of the liquid fractions over 6 months of storage, there were still only 10-20% of the total ellagitannins present in the liquid fractions.

On the other hand, predictions made in peel for some varieties differed from the results obtained in pulp. In this sense, MX2 (2000) and PT (2000) classified as bitter in pulp were predicted as nonbitter in peel, whereas GG (2001) and MX11 (2001), nonbitter in pulp, were classified as bitter in peel. An explanation of this observation could be the fact that apple peel composition depends to a great extent on climatology (6) and sun exposure of the fruit, existing differences according to the position of the fruit in the tree and even, in the same fruit, between sun-exposed parts and shaded parts (25). Considering the peel and pulp distribution of polyphenols in the different apple cultivars studied, it was confirmed that the synthesis and accumulation of phenolic compounds are specific to each kind of apple tissue (peel, pulp), which had been previously reported (25, 26). Taking into account the objective of this study, and as a result of the observations made, pulp predictions were considered as more reliable than those in peel, because they were more homogeneous and did not depend so much on external factors. However, it is important to note that for 80% of the samples, bitterness predictions are concordant in pulp and peel, which allows the conclusion that apple tissues present characteristic compositions that permit them to be distinguished from a technological point of view."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "NONE"}], "meta": {"split": "train", "paper_id": "polyphenolic-profiles-of-basque-cider-apple-cultivars-and-their-technological-properties", "chunk_id": "p31", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

The amount of phenolic compounds present in cereals was very low, amounting to 0.2-1. mg gallic acid equivalents/g of crude phenolic extract (41). The low antioxidant activity of cereal extracts even at a 5000 ppm level against oxidation of methyl linoleate was also reported by Kahkonen et al. (41). The low TPC in the above study may possibly be due to the inclusion of only free phenolics in the analysis. However, in cereals, phenolic compounds exist primarily in the bound form in association with cell wall materials (10-13, 42-44). The present study also demonstrated the significant contribution of bound phenolic compounds to the TPCs of whole grains, flours, and brans of soft and hard wheats. Thus, it is apparent why cereals could exhibit low TPCs when tested only for their free phenolic acids. A similar conclusion was reached by Dewanto et al. (45) for corn phenolics and dominance of bound phenolics. Sosulski et al. (10) reported that 69.2% of TPCs in wheat was due to insoluble-bound phenolics. They also reported that levels of soluble conjugated phenolic acids in cereal flours were 2-5 times higher than those of their free phenolic acids."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "cereals | phenolic compounds | 0.2-1. | mg GAE/g crude phenolic extract"}], "meta": {"split": "train", "paper_id": "importance-of-insoluble-bound-phenolics-to-antioxidant-properties-of-wheat", "chunk_id": "p38", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

The anthocyanin bioavailability of red cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var. capitata) was evaluated as reflected by urinary excretion of anthocyanins and anthocyanin metabolites. Twelve volunteers consumed 100, 200, and 300 g of steamed red cabbage (containing 1. $\\mu$ mol of anthocyanins/g of cabbage) in a crossover design. Anthocyanin concentration in cabbage extract and urine was measured by HPLC-MS/MS. Six nonacylated and 30 acylated anthocyanins were detected in red cabbage, and 3 nonacylated anthocyanins, 8 acylated anthocyanins, and 4 metabolites were present in urine. Mean 24 h excretion of intact anthocyanins increased linearly from 45 (100 g dose) to 65 nmol (300 g dose) for acylated anthocyanins and from 52 (100 g dose) to 79 nmol (300 g dose) for nonacylated anthocyanins. Urinary recovery of intact anthocyanins (percent of anthocyanin intake) decreased linearly from 0.041% (100 g dose) to 0.020% (300 g dose) for acylated anthocyanins and from 0.18% (100 g dose) to 0.09% (300 g dose) for nonacylated anthocyanins. Anthocyanin metabolites consisted of glucuronidated and methylated anthocyanins. The results show that red cabbage anthocyanins were excreted in both intact and metabolized forms and that recovery of nonacylated anthocyanins in urine was >4-fold that of acylated anthocyanins."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "steamed red cabbage | anthocyanins | 1 | µmol/g cabbage"}], "meta": {"split": "train", "paper_id": "effect-of-dose-size-on-bioavailability-of-acylated-and-nonacylated-anthocyanins-from-red-cabbage-(brassica-oleracea-l", "chunk_id": "p3", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

Phenolics, especially flavonoids, are suggested as being essential bioactive compounds providing health benefits. In this study, twenty-seven vegetables, fifteen aromatic herbs and some spices consumed in Central Italy (the Marches region) were studied to reveal total phenolic, flavonoid and flavanol content as well as their anti-oxidant capacity measured by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) method. A comparison in terms of antioxidant capacity was made between different salads, as well as between salads to which aromatic herbs had been added. Lemon balm and marjoram at a concentration of 1. % w/w increased by 150 % and 200 % respectively the antioxidant capacity of a salad portion. A 200 g portion of a salad enriched with marjoram corresponded to an intake of 200 (sd 10) mg phenolics and 4000 (sd 300) ORAC units (µmol Trolox equivalents). Olive oils and wine or apple vinegars were the salad dressings that provided the highest increase in antioxidant capacity. Among the spices tested, cumin and fresh ginger made the most significant contribution to the antioxidant capacity. The results are useful in surveying the antioxidant parameters of vegetables, herbs and spices produced and consumed in our geographical area as well as in quantifying the daily intake of phenolics and ORAC units.

The studied compounds identified in our experiment can share a part of that role. As well, many health-beneficial effects of walnut phenolics have also been described (10, 15–17, 30). Much higher contents of phenolics, especially of syringic acid, juglone, and ellagic acid, were observed in the pellicle. In pellicle as well as in kernel the lowest contents of ferulic acid and sinapic acid were found among the identified phenolics, but Rice-Evans et al. (31) found that sinapic acid was the one with higher antioxidative activity, among other phenolic acids (ferulic, caffeic, p-coumaric, syringic, and vanillic acid). Moreover, the study showed differences in the sum of all identified phenolics between the cultivars. The highest differences were observed between Rasna and Fernette fruits; in Rasna there were >2-fold higher contents of identified phenolics in both kernel (the sum was 85. mg/100 g) and pellicle (the sum was 2500. mg/100 g). Gunduc and El (12) reported total phenolics content of up to 7052 mg/kg of walnut kernel.

The flow rate was $0. \\text{ mL min}^{-1}$ , and the injection volume was $50 \\mu\\text{L}$ for the crude extracts or $10 \\mu\\text{L}$ for the thiolysis media. The chromatographic separation was carried out at $25 ^\\circ\\text{C}$ . Catechins and dihydrochalcones were monitored and quantified at $280 \\text{ nm}$ , hydroxycinnamic acids at $320 \\text{ nm}$ , flavonols at $370 \\text{ nm}$ , and anthocyanins at $530 \\text{ nm}$ . Polyphenol identification was achieved by comparison of their retention times and their UV-visible spectra with those of the standards that were available. Some other chromatographic peaks were assigned to a particular polyphenol class according to their UV-visible spectra and bibliographic sources. In this sense, those unknown chromatographic peaks that exhibit flavan-3-ol spectra were appointed as CAT-n, and those with a spectrum of 5-caffeoylquinic acid as CAA-n, of p-coumaric as CMA-n, of dihydrochalcone as PLD-n, of flavonol as QG-n and of anthocyanin as CG-n (where n is a number). Quantification was performed by reporting the measured integration areas in the calibration equation of the corresponding standards. Thus, procyanidin B2 and the unknown flavan-3-ols were quantified as (+)-catechin, phloretin 2'-O-xyloglucoside and the unknown dihydrochalcones as phloridzin, avicularin and the unknown flavonols as rutin, CAA-n species as 5-caffeoylquinic acid, 4-p-coumaroylquinic acid and CMA-n species as p-coumaric acid, and the unknown anthocyanins as ideain."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "NONE"}], "meta": {"split": "train", "paper_id": "polyphenolic-profiles-of-basque-cider-apple-cultivars-and-their-technological-properties", "chunk_id": "p14", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

(ellagic acid) to 3738. (lambertianin D) (4,5). The ellagitannins in black berries are located predominantly in the seeds (4,6), but some are found in the torus (receptacle tissue), and only a few are present in the flesh (4). Several studies have evaluated the ellagitannin content in blackberries with values ranging from 8 to > 70 mg/100 g of FW (7-9). There are no current studies on processed blackberries that report the amount of ellagitannins in their native forms. However, one study (10) reported that ellagic acid in raspberry jam (not hydrolyzed from ellagitannins) increased 2-fold with processing and 3-fold over 6 months of storage, presumably as a result of ellagitannin depolymerization. This suggests that evaluation of native ellagitannin content changes may offer a greater understanding of the potential bioavailability of these phenolics, because they range in molecular weight and number of hexahydroxydiphenic acid moieties."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "blackberries | ellagitannins | 8-70 | mg/100 g FW\nraspberry jam | ellagic acid | 2 | fold increase (processing)\nraspberry jam (6 months storage) | ellagic acid | 3 | fold increase"}], "meta": {"split": "train", "paper_id": "processing-and-storage-effects-on-the-ellagitannin-composition-of-processed-blackberry-products", "chunk_id": "p3", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

The concentrations of ellagitannins in purees made from flesh did not change during storage. In purees made from berry homogenate and achene-enriched fraction, 80 and 72% of the initial ellagitannins remained in the purees after 16 weeks at 22 °C, respectively.

The concentration of ellagic acid in the purees increased steadily during storage and was nearly doubled after 16 weeks at 22 °C. Yet, the level of ellagic acid might be underestimated because of the low solubility of free ellagic acid. The increase in free ellagic acid may be explained by release of ellagic acid after hydrolysis of the ellagitannins. In raspberry jam, free ellagic acid was almost doubled after the first month of storage at 20 °C and then the concentration decreased during the next 3 months (16). In strawberry jam, total ellagic acid content did not change during storage for 9 months at -20 °C or at 5 °C (17).

The latter group also includes infants with severe or mild physiological dysfunctions, such as milk protein allergies, postdiarrhoea lactose intolerance, galactosemia, and primary lactase deficiency. In addition, great impulse to the consumption of soy foods has been given by the acceptance of the US Food and Drug Administration of the claim that consuming 25 g soybean proteins per day is useful for preventing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), based on the available data on the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in hypercholesterolemic subjects [2–4]. This activity depends on the soybean proteins per se [5–7] and in particular on the a<sup>0</sup> subunit of the 7S globulins .

A positive linear relationship between total phenolics and antioxidant capacity was observed in spinach. However, the relationship between total phenolics and ORAC in spinach was less pronounced than the highly linear relationship observed between total phenolics and ORAC in blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries (9, 11). The lower correlation observed between these variables could be explained by the complex flavonoid composition of spinach. Only two of the flavonoid compounds (1 and 3) in spinach showed significant free radical scavenging activity against the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (15). Both of the patuletin derivatives have a 3',4'dihydroxyl grouping, an important structural feature known to increase the free-radical scavenging capacity of flavonoids (18). Interestingly, the two patuletin derivatives, compounds 1 and 3, correlated highly with ORAC in our study ( $r{xy} = 0.74$ and 0.71, respectively), which indirectly corroborates their contribution to antioxidant capacity. Our results concerning the relationship between total phenolics, flavonoids, and ORAC are also consistent with those of Guo et al. (33), who found that electroactive components in spinach extracts determined by HPLC coupled with coulometric array detection did not correlate with ORAC as well as electroactive components measured in other fruits and vegetables. Thus, it appears that although spinach is a rich source of flavonoids, only compounds with a 3',4'-dihydroxyl grouping, which accounted for only 22% of the total flavonoid content, show significant free radical scavenging capacity. Besides flavonoids, other water-soluble compounds not measured in the study could also contribute significantly to ORAC. Isomers of p-coumaric acid and uridine extracted from spinach leaves are reported to be potent inhibitors of linoleic acid autoxidation (34)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "NONE"}], "meta": {"split": "val", "paper_id": "antioxidant-capacity-and-phenolic-content-of-spinach-as-affected-by-genetics-and-growing-season", "chunk_id": "p30", "chunk_type": "paragraph"}}

The total flavonoid content of spinach is high (1000 mg/ kg) (15), compared with those of other fruits and vegetables (16). Plant-derived polyphenolic flavonoids exhibit numerous biological and pharmacological properties (16-18) that could potentially afford protection against chronic diseases. Spinach flavonols, in particular, have been shown to possess antioxidant (15, 19), antiinflammatory (20, 21), antimutagenic (22), and anticarcinogenic (23) properties. The 10 predominant flavonoids in spinach include glucuronides and acylated di- and triglycosides of methylated and methylenedioxiderivatives of 6-oxygenated flavonols (15, 24-26).

The median of total phenols content was 38 ppm (as syringic acid), although a wide range was observed, from 11 to 76 ppm. The main phenols found were the dialdehydic form of elenolic acid linked to tyrosol (p-HPEA-EDA; $9 \\pm 7$ ppm, as median and interquartile range), oleuropein aglycon ( $8 \\pm 6$ ppm), and the dialdehydic form of elenolic acid linked to hydroxytyrosol (3,4-DHPEA-EDA; $5\\pm8$ ppm).

The relative increase in the water-extractability of DF during dough mixing was probably caused by the solubilisation of WUE DF components. The decrease in the total DF content can be explained by breakdown of WE DF components to smaller molecules which were no longer precipitated by 80% ethanol and thus not counted as DF by the method used. No changes in water extractability were measured during dough proofing. However, this does not exclude the possibility that some breakdown of AX to lower molecular weight polymers could have occurred during this processing step.

Activities of α-amylase, β-xylosidase, α-arabinofuranosidase, and cinnamoyl esterase(s) were found in extracts of wholemeal and in dough after mixing and proofing, whereas activity of endo-xylanase was only found in the wholemeal. As a result of dough mixing, the content of total DF decreased by 21%, which was caused by a decrease in the amount of water-unextractable (WUE) DF. The content of water-extractable (WE) DF was unchanged during the bread-making process, but the relative content of WE DF increased. The content of total ester-bound phenolic acids and ferulic acid dehydrodimers decreased from 1575 µg/g in the wholemeal to 1472 µg/g in rye bread.
